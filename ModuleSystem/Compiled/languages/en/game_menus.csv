menu_start_game_0|Welcome, adventurer, to Mount and Blade: Warband. Before beginning the game you must create your character.

That does not however mean that you should not choose to play a female character, or one who is not of noble birth. Male nobles may have a somewhat easier start, but women and commoners can attain all of the same goals -- and in fact may have a much more interesting if more challenging early game.

You sold the apples on the market and bought goods of even greater value. You are ambitious and determined to get rich.

You think the war between the French and the Anglo-Burgundians could be a good way to finally get rich. 
menu_classe_chasseur|You are a mountaineer and a hunter, more at home with the wolves and bears than among the residents of large cities.

You have decided to join the rebels and rumours in the taverns point you towards hidden rebel camps in the forests near large cities.
menu_classe_bandit|You are a highwayman with a black heart, willing to spend time only on figuring out the right time to sell the property taken from others.
