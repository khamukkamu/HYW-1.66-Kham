dlga_event_triggered:freelancer_sarge_1|{playername}, I've been watching you and I am quite impressed with your progress.^ I've spoken to the men and they agree with my decision.
dlga_freelancer_sarge_1:freelancer_sarge_2|Thank you, my {reg3?Lady:Lord}, I try my best to bring honour to your house.^ What decision is that?
dlga_freelancer_sarge_2:freelancer_sarge_3|You will now be one of my {s5}, commanding a group of 7 men. Your new salary should cover theirs, so will the improved rations I will be giving you.^ Also, as a symbol of your new authority, I will reward you a choice of a two things.^ {s6}, both made by my personal blacksmith.
dlga_freelancer_sarge_3:freelancer_sarge_finish|I choose the shield. I will not let you nor the men down. You can count on me.
dlga_freelancer_sarge_3:freelancer_sarge_finish.1|I choose the weapon. I will not let you nor the men down. You can count on me.
dlga_freelancer_sarge_finish:close_window|Good to hear it, {playername}. I'll have someone deliver it to you. Now go and meet your men.
dlga_event_triggered:freelancer_cap_1|{playername}, You have once again truly proved your worth. You are an example to all of our men.
dlga_freelancer_cap_1:freelancer_cap_2|Thank you, my {reg3?Lady:Lord}. A soldier is only as good as their commander.
dlga_freelancer_cap_2:freelancer_cap_3|From now on, you will be my {s5}, commanding a group of 15 men. You will also be given a considerable wage increase, as befit your station.^ I have also something to give you, choose between {s6}, straight from our family's treasures...^
dlga_freelancer_cap_3:freelancer_cap_finish|The armour will help me defend you from your enemies. I will continue bringing honour to your house.
dlga_freelancer_cap_3:freelancer_cap_finish.1|The weapon will help me destroy your enemies. I will continue bringing honour to your house.
dlga_freelancer_cap_finish:close_window|I know you will, {playername}. Now go and meet your men.
dlga_event_triggered:lord_start|You are back, {playername}.
dlga_event_triggered:close_window|{playername}, I am here to tell you that your vacation is over. Join me and return to your post.
dlga_event_triggered:freelancer_pacify_duel_win|Ha! Good fight, good fight! Exactly what the men were looking for. We should do this more, eh?
dlga_event_triggered:freelancer_pacify_duel_lose|Alright, we've entertained the men, now for the good stuff. Pay up!
dlga_event_triggered:freelancer_pacify_start|...blood and guts everywhere, then the rats eat the blood and guts! At least they are feasting, eh! Unlike us, covered with blood, guts, and shit!{s5}
dlga_event_triggered:freelancer_mission_start|{playername}, I have a task for you.
dlga_freelancer_mission_start:freelancer_lord_mission_told_pacify|{playername}, as you are probably well aware, some of are troops are unhappy. Whether it is the losses we have suffered, or perhaps a lack of beer or ale, there are rumblings among the men.This cannot stand. I want you to go and placate them. Do what you must, as long as we can continue on without this air of dissatisfaction.
dlga_freelancer_lord_mission_told_pacify:freelancer_lord_mission_pacify_accepted|I will do what I can to pacify the men.
dlga_freelancer_lord_mission_told_pacify:freelancer_lord_mission_pacify_declined|I cannot accept this mission.
dlga_freelancer_lord_mission_pacify_accepted:close_window|Very good. I look forward to hearing back from you.
dlga_freelancer_lord_mission_pacify_declined:close_window|That is unfortunate, {playername}. Perhaps you are one of the unhappy ones too... Go back to your post.

dlga_freelancer_pacify_persuade:freelancer_pacify_persuade_fail|{s5}
dlga_freelancer_pacify_persuade_success:close_window|Good. I'll let the commander know.
dlga_freelancer_pacify_persuade_fail:close_window|I am sorry that I cannot convince you. I'll let the commander know.
dlga_freelancer_pacify_attempt:freelancer_pacify_fight|So, the men wants to have fun? They want a bit of entertainment? (Duel)
dlga_freelancer_pacify_fight:freelancer_pacify_fight_ask|So, the men wants to have fun? They want a bit of entertainment? Well, we can give them a show right now. You and I have a friendly duel, and if I win, convince the men to stop their grumbling. If you win, well, I'll pay the men 15 crowns each. What do you say?
dlga_freelancer_pacify_fight_ask:freelancer_pacify_fight_ask_weapons|Sounds good. With weapons or fists?
dlga_freelancer_pacify_fight_ask_weapons:freelancer_pacify_fight_ask_weapons_choose_weapons|Weapons.

dlga_freelancer_pacify_fight_ask_weapons_choose_fists:close_window|Let's begin then! Put em up!
dlga_freelancer_pacify_duel_win:close_window|Definitely. Now that the fun is over, the men seems to be in better spirits. I'll let the commander know. Good fight.
dlga_freelancer_pacify_duel_lose:close_window|Good fight... I am a man of my word. Here, distribute it to the men.
dlga_freelancer_pacify_duel_lose:close_window.1|Good fight... I am a man of my word. But I do not have enough... here, take all that I have
dlga_freelancer_pacify_attempt:freelancer_pacify_booze|Well, it so happens that I have some booze that we can all share. What do you say?
dlga_freelancer_pacify_booze:close_window|Now you are talking! Let the merry-making begin!
dlga_freelancer_pacify_attempt:freelancer_pacify_bribe|If crowns are what the men want, crowns are what I can offer. How much do you think the men want?
dlga_freelancer_pacify_bribe:freelancer_pacify_bribe_ask|Now we are talking, eh? Beer is expensive, at {reg4} for a few cases, and there are quite a lot of us men that would like to drink and enjoy ourselves. So we think {reg6} crowns should cover it and whatever extras we want.
dlga_freelancer_pacify_bribe_ask:freelancer_pacify_bribe_pay|I see... I have that amount. Here are your {reg6} crowns. Spend it wisely, and no more grumblings.
dlga_freelancer_pacify_bribe_ask:freelancer_pacify_bribe_not_enough|I see... I do not have enough money.
dlga_freelancer_pacify_bribe_ask:freelancer_pacify_bribe_pay.1|I see... I do know a place where we can get your beer for cheaper. Here, for {reg6} crowns, you will get everything you need.
dlga_freelancer_pacify_bribe_pay:close_window|Great! Let us go buy it now and distribute it to the men. Once they are all drunk, there will be no more complaining. 
dlga_lord_start:freelancer_pacify_success|{playername}, It seems our men are of better spirits. I do not need to know what you did, just know that I am thankful.
dlga_freelancer_pacify_success:close_window|The men just needed something to occupy their time. I will go back to my post.
dlga_freelancer_mission_start:freelancer_lord_mission_told_deserters|{playername}, there has been a number of deserters in our ranks. In our nation, we do not tolerate cowards. Have them taste the steel they are so afraid of, make examples of them.
dlga_freelancer_lord_mission_told_deserters:freelancer_lord_mission_deserters_accepted|I do not tolerate cowards. I will hunt them down and end them.
dlga_freelancer_lord_mission_told_deserters:freelancer_lord_mission_deserters_declined|I cannot accept this mission.
dlga_freelancer_lord_mission_deserters_accepted:close_window|Glad to hear it. Take some men with you, these deserters are not common bandits. I look forward to your report. They should be nearby, do not linger or else they will get away.
dlga_freelancer_lord_mission_deserters_declined:close_window|Hm. I'm disappointed, {playername}. I might start thinking that you are a coward too. Go back to your post. I need to go and find somebody to hunt them down for us.
dlga_lord_start:lord_freelancer_deserters_thank|I've heard from our scouts that you have defeated the party of deserters. The men will now think twice about running away from this war. Good job, {playername}. Go back to your post.
dlga_lord_start:lord_freelancer_deserters_fail|I've heard from our scouts that you have failed to defeat the party of deserters. Quite disappointing, it may even embolden other cowards to join them. Go back to your post, I'll send other men to hunt them down.
dlga_freelancer_mission_start:freelancer_lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints|{playername}, I need a volunteer to scout the area. We're sorely lacking on information, and I simply must have a better picture of the situation before we can proceed. Do you want to accept this mission?
dlga_freelancer_lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints:freelancer_lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints_accepted|You've found your volunteer, sir.
dlga_freelancer_lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints:freelancer_lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints_rejected|I cannot accept this mission.
dlga_freelancer_lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints_accepted:close_window|Good {man/lass}! {s5} and check out what's there. Make a note of anything you find and return to me as soon as possible.
dlga_freelancer_lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints_rejected:close_window|Hm. I'm disappointed, {playername}. Go back to your post. I need to go and find somebody to scout for us.
dlga_freelancer_mission_start:freelancer_mission_deliver_message|I need to send a letter to {s13} who should be currently at {s4}. If you will be heading towards there, would you deliver it to him? The letter needs to be in his hands in 10 days.
dlga_freelancer_mission_deliver_message:freelancer_mission_deliver_message_accepted|Certainly, I intend to pass by {s4} and it would be no trouble.
dlga_freelancer_mission_deliver_message_accepted:close_window|I appreciate it, {playername}. Here's the letter, and a small sum to cover your travel expenses. Give my regards to {s13} when you see him.
dlga_freelancer_mission_deliver_message:freelancer_mission_deliver_message_rejected|Apologies, I cannot do this mission. You'd best send it with someone else.
dlga_freelancer_mission_deliver_message_rejected:close_window|That is too bad, {playername}. Go back to your post, then.
dlga_freelancer_mission_start:freelancer_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_told|I have something you could help with, an issue with the lawless villain known as {s4}. He murdered one of my men and has been on the run from his judgment ever since. I can't let him get away with avoiding justice, so I've put a bounty of 300 denars on his head. Friends of the murdered man reckon that this assassin may have taken refuge with his kinsmen at {s3}. You might be able to hunt him down and give him what he deserves, and claim the bounty for yourself.
dlga_freelancer_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_told:freelancer_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_accepted|Then I will hunt him down and execute the law.
dlga_freelancer_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_told:freelancer_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_rejected|Apologies, I cannot do this mission. You'd best send it with someone else.
dlga_freelancer_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_accepted:close_window|That's excellent, {playername}. I will be grateful to you and so will the family of the man he murdered. And of course the bounty on his head will be yours if you can get him. Well, good hunting to you.
dlga_freelancer_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_rejected:close_window|As you wish, {playername}. Go back to your post.

dlga_start:fighter_talk|Hello there. We are polishing off our combat skills here with a bit of sparring practice. You look like you could use a bit of training. Why don't you join us, and we can show you a few tricks. And if you need explanation of any combat concepts, just ask, and I will do my best to fill you in.
dlga_start:fighter_talk.1|What do you want to practice?
dlga_fighter_pretalk:fighter_talk|Tell me what kind of practice you want.
dlga_fighter_talk:fighter_talk_train_attack|I want to practice attacking.
dlga_fighter_talk:fighter_talk_train_parry|I want to practice blocking with my weapon.
dlga_fighter_talk:fighter_talk_train_combat|Let's do some sparring practice.
dlga_fighter_talk:close_window|[Leave]
dlga_fighter_talk_train_attack:fighter_talk_train_attack_2|All right. There are four principle directions for attacking. These are overhead swing, right swing, left swing and thrust. Now, I will tell you which direction to attack from and you must try to do the correct attack. ^^(Move your mouse while you press the left mouse button to specify attack direction. For example, to execute an overhead attack, move the mouse up at the instant you press the left mouse button. The icons on your screen will help you do the correct action.)
dlga_fighter_talk_train_attack_2:close_window|Let's begin then. I am ready.
dlga_fighter_talk_train_attack_2:fighter_pretalk|Actually I want to do something else.
dlga_fighter_talk_train_parry:fighter_talk_train_parry_2|Unlike a shield, blocking with a weapon can only stop attacks coming from one direction. For example if you block up, you'll deflect overhead attacks, but you can still be hit by side swings or thrust attacks. ^^(You must press and hold down the right mouse button to block.)
dlga_fighter_talk_train_parry_2:fighter_talk_train_parry_3|I'll now attack you with different types of strokes, and I will wait until you do the correct block before attacking. Try to do the correct block as soon as you can. ^^(This practice is easy to do with the 'automatic block direction' setting which is the default. If you go to the Options menu and change defend direction control to 'mouse movement' or 'keyboard', you'll need to manually choose block direction. This is much more challenging, but makes the game much more interesting. This practice can be very useful if you use manual blocking.)
dlga_fighter_talk_train_parry_3:close_window|Let's begin then. I am ready.
dlga_fighter_talk_train_parry_3:fighter_pretalk|Actually I want to do something else.
dlga_fighter_talk_train_combat:fighter_talk_train_combat_2|Sparring is an excellent way to prepare for actual combat. We'll fight each other with non-lethal weapons now, until one of us falls to the ground. You can get some bruises of course, but better that than being cut down in the real thing.
dlga_fighter_talk_train_combat_2:close_window|Let's begin then. I am ready.
dlga_fighter_talk_train_combat_2:fighter_pretalk|Actually I want to do something else.
dlga_start:fighter_parry_try_again|Good. You were able to block my attacks successfully. You may repeat this practice and try to get faster each time, until you are confident of your defense skills. Do you want to have another go?
dlga_start:fighter_parry_try_again.1|Well that didn't go too well, did it? (Remember, you must press and hold down the right mouse button to keep your block effective.) Do you want to try again?
dlga_fighter_parry_try_again:fighter_talk_train_parry|Yes. Let's try again.
dlga_fighter_parry_try_again:fighter_talk_leave_parry|No, I think I am done for now.
dlga_start:fighter_parry_warn|Hey! We are doing a blocking practice, mate! You are supposed to block my attacks, not attack me back.
dlga_fighter_parry_warn:fighter_talk_train_parry|I am sorry. Let's try once again.
dlga_fighter_parry_warn:fighter_talk_leave_parry|Sorry. I must leave this practice now.
dlga_fighter_talk_leave_parry:close_window|All right. As you wish.
dlga_start:fighter_combat_try_again|Well that didn't go too well, did it?  Don't feel bad, and try not to do same mistakes next time. Do you want to have a go again?
dlga_fighter_combat_try_again:fighter_talk_train_combat|Yes. Let's do another round.
dlga_fighter_combat_try_again:fighter_talk_leave_combat|No. That was enough for me.
dlga_fighter_talk_leave_combat:close_window|Well, all right. Talk to me again if you change your mind.
dlga_start:fighter_combat_try_again.1|Hey, that was good sparring. You defeated me, but next time I'll be more careful. Do you want to have a go again?
dlga_start:fighter_talk.2|Very good. You have learned how to attack from any direction you want. If you like we can try this again or move to a different exercise.
dlga_start:archer_challenge_2|Not bad. Not bad at all! You seem to have grasped the basics of archery. Now, try to do the same thing with a crossbow. Take the crossbow and the bolts over there and shoot those three targets. The crossbow is much easier to shoot with compared with the bow, but you need to reload it after each shot.
dlga_start:archer_challenge_2.1|Good. You didn't have too much difficulty using the crossbow either. Next you will learn to use throwing weapons. Pick up the javelins you see over there and try to hit those three targets. 
dlga_start:ranged_end|Well, with that you have received the basic skills to use all three types of ranged weapons. The rest will come with practice. Train each and every day, and in time you will be as good as the best marksmen in whole length and breadth of jolly old England.
dlga_ranged_end:close_window|Now, you can go talk with the melee fighters or the horsemanship trainer if you haven't already done so. They can teach you important skills too.
dlga_start:archer_talk|Good day to you, young fellow. I spend my days teaching about ranged weapons to anyone that is willing to learn. If you need a tutor, let me know and I'll teach you how to use the bow, the crossbow and the javelin.
dlga_archer_talk:archer_challenge|Yes, show me how to use ranged weapons.
dlga_archer_talk:close_window|No, not now.
dlga_archer_challenge:archer_challenge_2|All right. Your first training will be in archery. The bow is a difficult weapon to master. But once you are sufficiently good at it, you can shoot quickly and with great power. Go pick up the bow and arrows you see over there now and shoot those targets.
dlga_archer_challenge_2:close_window|All right. I am ready.
dlga_archer_challenge_2:close_window.1|Just a minute. I want to do something else first.
dlga_start:horseman_melee_challenge_2|I hope you enjoyed the ride. Now we move on to something a bit more difficult. Grab the lance you see over there and ride around the course hitting each target at least once.
dlga_start:horseman_melee_challenge_2.1|Good! You have been able to hit all targets on horseback. That's no easy feat for a starter. Your next challenge will be using a bow and arrows to shoot at the archery targets by the road. You need to put an arrow to each target to consider yourself successful.
dlga_start:horsemanship_end|Very good. You were able to shoot all targets from horseback. Keep riding and practising each day and in time you will be an expert horseman.
dlga_horsemanship_end:close_window|Now, you can go talk with the melee fighters or the archery trainer if you haven't already done so. You need to learn everything you can to be prepared when you have to defend yourself.
dlga_start:horseman_talk|Good day! I have come here for some riding practice, but my old bones are aching badly so I decided to give myself a rest today. If you would like to practice your horsemanship, you can take my horse here. The exercise would be good for her.
dlga_horseman_talk:horseman_challenge|Yes, I would like to practice riding.
dlga_horseman_talk:close_window|Uhm. Maybe later.
dlga_horseman_challenge:horseman_melee_challenge_2|Good. Now, I will give you a few exercises that'll teach you riding and horseback weapon use. Your first assignment is simple. Just take your horse for a ride around the course. Go as slow or as fast as you like. Come back when you feel confident as a rider and I'll give you some tougher exercises.
dlga_horseman_melee_challenge_2:close_window|All right. I am ready.
dlga_horseman_melee_challenge_2:close_window.1|Just a minute. I need to do something else first.
dlga_tutorial_troop_default:close_window|Hey, I am trying to practice here. Go, talk with the archery trainer if you need guidance about ranged weapons.
dlga_start:lord_prison_break_confirm_3|Is there a change of plans?
dlga_start:lord_prison_break|What's going on?
dlga_start:drunk_response|What are you looking at?
dlga_start:drunk_response.1|Are you looking at me?
dlga_player_duel_response:close_window|Such a waste...
dlga_player_duel_response:close_window.1|Better him than me
dlga_drunk_response:drunk_fight_start|I'm not sure... Some sort of animal, clearly
dlga_drunk_response:drunk_fight_start.1|Excuse me -- please accept my apologies
dlga_drunk_fight_start:close_window|I'll wipe that smirk right off your face!
dlga_drunk_response:drunk_player_high_renown|Do you have any idea who I am?
dlga_drunk_player_high_renown:drunk_fight_start|Do I care?
dlga_drunk_player_high_renown:drunk_player_high_renown|Emmm... Actually... Yes, yes, I do know who you are, {sir/madame}. Please forgive me, your grace -- it must be the drink. I'll be leaving, now...
dlga_drunk_player_high_renown:drunk_fight_start.1|Why, if you want a fight, you shall have one!
dlga_drunk_player_high_renown:close_window|I thought as much. Now, remove yourself from here
dlga_start:fistfight_response|You look like a {fellow/lady} who can take a few hard knocks -- and deal them out, too. I have a business proposition for you.
dlga_fistfight_response:fistfight_response_2|How's that?
dlga_fistfight_response_2:fistfight_response_2a|Good -- I'm glad you're interested. Here's the plan... It's a little complicated, so listen well. 
dlga_fistfight_response_2a:fistfight_response_3|You and this other fellow will start up a fight here. No weapons, no armor -- I'll sit back and take bets, and split the profits with the winner. If we make a loss, then I'll cover it. You've got nothing to lose -- except a bit of blood, of course.
dlga_fistfight_response_3:fistfight_response_4|However, we can't organize this like one of those nice arena bouts, where everyone places their bets beforehand. People will walk in, drawn by the noise, and put a denar or two on whichever one of your two they think is winning. I'll give 'em even odds -- anything else is going to be too tricky for someone who's already on his third flagon of ale.
dlga_fistfight_response_4:fistfight_response_4a|So, as you can see, the trick is to stretch things out for as long as possible where it looks like you're losing, and people bet against you -- and then come back fast, and win, before the betting can turn. The best way to make money is for you to be battered almost to the floor, and then jump back off your feet and take the other guy down. However, you have to win in the end in order for me, and you, to make money. 
dlga_fistfight_response_4a:fistfight_response_5|Also, you can't stretch the fight out too long, or people will suspect a fix. So, one of you has to take a punch every so often. I don't care whose blood is spilled, but there has to be some blood.
dlga_fistfight_response_5:fistfight_response_5a|And one other thing -- my mate, your opponent, he doesn't take to well to complexity. So he's just going to come straight at you. It's up to you to supply the artistry.
dlga_fistfight_response_5a:fistfight_response_confirm|So, what do you think?
dlga_fistfight_response_confirm:close_window.1|I have better things to do
dlga_start:ramun_introduce_1|Good day to you, {young man/lassie}.
dlga_ramun_introduce_1:ramun_introduce_2|Forgive me, you look like a trader, but I see none of your merchandise.
dlga_ramun_introduce_1:close_window|Never mind.
dlga_ramun_introduce_2:ramun_introduce_3|A trader? Oh, aye, I certainly am that. My merchandise is a bit different from most, however. It has to be fed and watered twice a day and tries to run away if I turn my back.
dlga_ramun_introduce_3:ramun_introduce_4|Livestock?
dlga_ramun_introduce_4:ramun_introduce_5|Close enough. I like to call myself the man who keeps every boat on this ocean moving. Boats are driven by oars, you see, and oars need men to pull them or they stop. That's where I come in.
dlga_ramun_introduce_5:ramun_introduce_6|Galley slaves.
dlga_ramun_introduce_6:ramun_introduce_7|Now you're catching on! A trading port like this couldn't survive without them. The ships lose a few hands on every voyage, so there's always a high demand. The captains come to me and they pay well.
dlga_ramun_introduce_7:ramun_introduce_8|Where do the slaves come from?
dlga_ramun_introduce_8:ramun_introduce_9|Mostly I deal in convicted criminals bought from the authorities. Others are prisoners of war from various nations, brought to me because I offer the best prices. However, on occasion I'll buy from privateers and other . . . 'individuals'. You can't be picky about your suppliers in this line of work. You wouldn't happen to have any prisoners with you, would you?
dlga_ramun_introduce_9:ramun_introduce_10|Me? 
dlga_ramun_introduce_10:ramun_introduce_11|Why not? If you intend to set foot outside this town, you're going to cross swords with someone sooner or later. And, God willing, you'll come out on top. Why not make some extra money off the whole thing? Take them alive, bring them back to me, and I'll pay you fifty crowns for each head. Don't much care who they are or where they come from.
dlga_ramun_introduce_11:ramun_introduce_12|Hmm. I'll think about it.
dlga_ramun_introduce_12:close_window|Do think about it! There's a lot of silver to be made, no mistake. More than enough for the both of us.
dlga_start:ramun_talk|Hello, {playername}.
dlga_ramun_pre_talk:ramun_talk|Anything else?
dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_sell_prisoners|I've brought you some prisoners, Ramun. Would you like a look?
dlga_ramun_sell_prisoners:ramun_sell_prisoners_2|Let me see what you have...
dlga_ramun_sell_prisoners_2:close_window|A pleasure doing business with you.
dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_ask_about_capturing|How do I take somebody as prisoner?
dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_ask_about_capturing.1|Can you tell me again about capturing prisoners?
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing:ramun_have_blunt_weapon|You're new to this, aren't you? Let me explain it in simple terms. The basic rule of taking someone prisoner is knocking him down with a blunt weapon, like a mace or a club, rather than cutting him open with a sword. That way he goes to sleep for a little while rather than bleeding to death, you see? I'm assuming you have a blunt weapon with you . . .
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon:ramun_have_blunt_weapon_yes|Of course.
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon:ramun_have_blunt_weapon_no|As a matter of fact, I don't.
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon_yes:ramun_ask_about_capturing_2|Good. Then all you need to do is beat the bugger down with your weapon, and when the fighting is over you clap him in irons. It's a bit different for nobles and such, they tend to be protected enough that it won't matter what kind of weapon you use, but your average rabble-rouser will bleed like a stuck pig if you get him with something sharp. I don't have many requirements in my merchandise, but I do insist they be breathing when I buy them.
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon_no:ramun_have_blunt_weapon_no_2|No? Heh, well, this must be your lucky day. I've got an old club lying around that I was going to throw away. It a bit battered, but still good enough bash someone until he stops moving. Here, have it.
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon_no_2:ramun_have_blunt_weapon_yes|Thanks, Ramun. Perhaps I may try my hand at it.
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing:ramun_ask_about_capturing_2|Alright, I'll try and explain it again in simple terms. The basic rule of taking someone prisoner is knocking him down with a blunt weapon, like a mace or a club, rather than cutting him open with a sword. That way he goes to sleep for a little while rather than bleeding to death, you see? It's a bit different for nobles and such, they tend to be protected enough that it won't matter what kind of weapon you use, but your average rabble-rouser will bleed like a stuck pig if you get him with something sharp.
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_2:ramun_ask_about_capturing_3|Alright, I think I understand. Anything else?
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_3:ramun_ask_about_capturing_4|Well, it's not as simple as all that. Blunt weapons don't do as much damage as sharp ones, so they won't bring your enemies down as quickly. And trust me, given the chance, most of the scum you run across would just as soon kill you as look at you, so don't expect any courtesy when you pull out a club instead of a sword. Moreover, having to drag prisoners to and fro will slow down your party, which is why some people simply set their prisoners free after the fighting is done. It's madness. How could anyone turn down all that silver, eh?
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_4:ramun_ask_about_capturing_5|Is that everything?
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_5:ramun_ask_about_capturing_7|Just one final thing. Managing prisoners safely is not an easy thing to do, you could call it a skill in itself. If you want to capture a lot of prisoners, you should try and learn the tricks of it yourself, or you won't be able to hang on to a single man you catch.
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_7:ramun_pre_talk|Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_leave|I'd better be going.
dlga_ramun_leave:close_window|Remember, any prisoners you've got, bring them to me. I'll pay you good silver for every one.

dlga_dial_ecuyer_ecur25oke:close_window|Thank you wholeheartedly. You will find the sword in a tomb in the crypts of the catacombs here in Paris. The only problem is that entry is prohibited, so you will perhaps need to bribe the guard. In this case I will reimburse you. Bring me my sword, I feel naked without it on the battlefield, or before God. 
dlga_start:Dijon_jacob1|Greetings, I am Father Jacob, I run the hospices, and as you see, the buildings are not sufficient to contain all the wounded of the war. We do not make distinction, Burgundians, English or even French, we must come in help to the dying, but what can I do for you?
dlga_Dijon_jacob1:dijon_soinsok|I'm hurt Father, can you heal me?
dlga_Dijon_jacob1:dijon_removebelesstete|I have a head wound, please do something.
dlga_Dijon_jacob1:dijon_removebelessbras|My arm is wounded, can you do something?
dlga_Dijon_jacob1:dijon_removebelessjambe|I have a leg injury, can you do something?
dlga_Dijon_jacob1:dijon_travailpere|Tell me about your work at the hospices.
dlga_Dijon_jacob1:dijon_benirok|Can you perfom a blessing over my men? They are brave soldiers, and your blessing would improve their morale, preparing them for the worst.
dlga_Dijon_jacob1:dijon_etrange|Do not pay attention to me, I'm just out for a walk.
dlga_dijon_etrange:close_window|Strange place for just walking around, my friend. Are you sane? One of the colleges in Metz could do something for you if need be.
dlga_dijon_soinsok:dijon_peresoinschers|Well, I don't have time to look after everyone as you can imagine, but I can make an effort if you pay me 200 crowns as compensation. It would allow me to buy food and medicine for the wounded.
dlga_dijon_peresoinschers:dijon_pereblessur|Okay, hurry if possible, I have much to do.
dlga_dijon_pereblessur:close_window|What a bad wound, let me tend it...
dlga_dijon_peresoinschers:predial_dijonpere|I can't afford that.
dlga_dijon_removebelesstete:dijon_removebelesstetepay|Lord! Did you know that your skull is open? We must close this horrible wound before it gets infected, it will cost 200 crowns.
dlga_dijon_removebelesstetepay:dijon_removebelessteteokn|Okay, here's the money, hurry, the pain is unbearable.
dlga_dijon_removebelesstetepay:dijon_removebelesstetenomon|I do not have the amount you request.
dlga_dijon_removebelesstetenomon:predial_dijonpere|I'm sorry, but I can not do anything in this case.
dlga_dijon_removebelessteteokn:predial_dijonpere|Well, be careful next time, I will no longer see to such an injury.
dlga_dijon_removebelessbras:dijon_removebelessbraspay|Indeed, this is a war wound, I do not ask you which side you are, or even if you are a thief, I just ask you if you have 100 crowns to pay for the care.
dlga_dijon_removebelessbraspay:dijon_removebelessbraspayokn|Okay, here's the money, hurry, I can barely move my arm.
dlga_dijon_removebelessbraspay:dijon_removebelessbraspayoknnomon|I do not have the amount you request.
dlga_dijon_removebelessbraspayoknnomon:predial_dijonpere|I'm sorry, but I can not do anything in this case.
dlga_dijon_removebelessbraspayokn:predial_dijonpere|Well, be careful next time, how about buying a shield?
dlga_dijon_removebelessjambe:dijon_removebelessjambepay|It's not serious, however you must clean the wound and change the bandages regularly. Ointments and bandages will cost 50 crowns.
dlga_dijon_removebelessjambepay:dijon_removebelessjambepayokn|Okay, here's the money, hurry, I'm barely standing.
dlga_dijon_removebelessjambepay:dijon_removebelessjambeon|I do not have the amount you request.
dlga_dijon_removebelessjambeon:predial_dijonpere|I'm sorry, but I can not do anything in this case.
dlga_dijon_removebelessjambepayokn:predial_dijonpere|I recommend you to be more careful, a little rest from afar fighting would make you the most good.
dlga_dijon_travailpere:predial_dijonpere|There is nothing to tell, I assure you. The army men brought me here. Almost all of them leave this place on a carriage. The war does a lot of damage, you know.
dlga_predial_dijonpere:Dijon_jacob1|Is there anything else I can help you with?
dlga_dijon_benirok:dijon_cher|Hmm, how could I refuse to bless these men? If they were to die in battle they must be ready. I could do it, but I have obligations. I might be able to free myself if compensated. A 200 denar donation should do the trick, it will allow us to order food and care for newcomers.
dlga_dijon_cher:dijon_benirokok|Naturally, my men are worth it.
dlga_dijon_cher:dijon_benirno|I do not have that kind of money.
dlga_dijon_cher:dijon_insultepere|It is far too expensive for a single prayer. You are truly religious, or a banker?
dlga_dijon_benirokok:close_window|Very well, in that case bring me to them...
dlga_dijon_benirno:predial_dijonpere|In this case, I would be more useful treating my patients. I'm confused, but I have to go to where I am most useful.
dlga_dijon_insultepere:close_window|Watch your words my son, everyone suffers in all camps. For my part I can not help everyone, I got this idea for a long time.
dlga_start:dijon_freree|Inter oves locum præsta. Et ab hædis me sequestra, Statuens in parte dextra.
dlga_dijon_freree:dijon_frerepere|Amen. Excuse me, what can you tell me about father Jacob?
dlga_dijon_freree:close_window|Nothing, I must go.
dlga_dijon_frerepere:dial_dijon_frerefin|Father Jacob has suffered lately. He's seen patients die, one after another. Most were so mutilated that they couldn't do anything for them, but still he wanted to be able to save them...
dlga_dial_dijon_frerefin:dijon_fin|Tell him to hold on, it will all end well.
dlga_dijon_fin:close_window|I will, thank you for your appreciation.
dlga_start:dijon_blesse|They got you too?
dlga_dijon_blesse:dijon_francais|Me?
dlga_dijon_blesse:close_window|Yes, they got me. I have to go now.
dlga_dijon_francais:dial_dijon_blessefin|For me the fighting is over, I can barely walk. A crossbow bolt passed through my thigh, it wasn't a pretty sight. But yours look good... for now anyway.
dlga_dial_dijon_blessefin:dijon_finin|Crossbow bolt, yikes...
dlga_dijon_finin:close_window|Indeed.
dlga_start:jacobin_belle|What a beautiful day my son, is it not?
dlga_jacobin_belle:jacobin_start|In fact my father is good.
dlga_jacobin_belle:jacobin_mauvaistmp|Really?
dlga_jacobin_mauvaistmp:jacobin_start|But of course my son, all seasons are beautiful when you are in the Lord's service. Each season gives a different harvest, the rain and the sun makes them grow, gives them flavor and aromas.
dlga_jacobin_start:jacobin_start2|But what are you doing to with the cloister my son, will you join us?
dlga_jacobin_predial:jacobin_start2|Do you want to know something else my son?
dlga_jacobin_start2:jacobin_soinstart|I just ask a healer, I am wounded.
dlga_jacobin_start2:jacobin_removebelesstete|I have a head injury, do something, it feels horrible.
dlga_jacobin_start2:jacobin_removebelessbras|I have an arm injury, I have great difficulty in moving it, can you do something?
dlga_jacobin_start2:jacobin_removebelessjambe|I have a leg injury, can you heal it?
dlga_jacobin_start2:jacobin_rensgueriss|What do you do during your days in the cloister?
dlga_jacobin_start2:close_window|I have to go elsewhere, but I'll be back.
dlga_jacobin_rensgueriss:jacobin_danger|Well we produce strong drinks, excellent quality cheese, a little wine, and I even heal people in the city. We provide for our humble needs and collect money to help the sick and the poor.
dlga_jacobin_danger:jacobin_dangerno|The English will never attack?
dlga_jacobin_dangerno:jacobin_predial|They do not dare, at least we hope. God's wrath will come upon them.
dlga_jacobin_soinstart:jacobin_soinokok|Well, I'm not the best doctor in France, but I can cure you of a spoiled tooth or heal an injury with my plants. I ask you 100 crowns in return.
dlga_jacobin_soinokok:jacobin_pereblessur|Do your best, but be quick.
dlga_jacobin_soinokok:jacobin_predial|I don't have enough money. I'll be back.
dlga_jacobin_removebelesstete:jacobin_removebelesstetepay|My God! Did you know that your skull is open? We must close this horrible wound before it gets infected, It will cost 200 crowns.
dlga_jacobin_removebelesstetepay:jacobin_removebelessteteokn|Okay, here's the money, hurry, I am somewhat disoriented.
dlga_jacobin_removebelesstetepay:jacobin_removebelesstetenomon|I don't have the money on me.
dlga_jacobin_removebelesstetenomon:jacobin_predial|I'm sorry, but I can not do anything in this case.
dlga_jacobin_removebelessteteokn:jacobin_predial|Well, be careful next time, you just came close to death.
dlga_jacobin_removebelessbras:jacobin_removebelessbraspay|Indeed, this is a terrible wound. 100 crowns to pay for care.
dlga_jacobin_removebelessbraspay:jacobin_removebelessbraspayokn|Okay, here's the money, quickly make the blood stop flowing.
dlga_jacobin_removebelessbraspay:jacobin_removebelessbraspayoknnomon|I do not have the amount you request.
dlga_jacobin_removebelessbraspayoknnomon:jacobin_predial|I'm sorry, but I can not do anything in this case.
dlga_jacobin_removebelessbraspayokn:jacobin_predial|Well, be careful next time, or you will lose your arm.
dlga_jacobin_removebelessjambe:jacobin_removebelessjambepay|It is not serious, however you must clean the wound and change the bandages regularly. Ointments and bandages will cost 50 crowns.
dlga_jacobin_removebelessjambepay:jacobin_removebelessjambepayokn|Okay, here's the money, hurry, I'm barely standing.
dlga_jacobin_removebelessjambepay:jacobin_removebelessjambeon|I do not have the amount you request.
dlga_jacobin_removebelessjambeon:jacobin_predial|I'm sorry, but I can not do anything in this case.
dlga_jacobin_removebelessjambepayokn:jacobin_predial|I recommend you to be more careful, and move on horseback for a while.
dlga_jacobin_soinokok:jacobin_infobest|Where can I find a better doctor, no offense...
dlga_jacobin_infobest:jacobin_predial|Ho, no harm. The best doctor I know of is father Jacob in Dijon. This may be inside enemy territory, but if you're suffering, you don't have a choice.
dlga_jacobin_pereblessur:close_window|Stop moving my son, you make me drop my knife every time...
dlga_start:jacobin_startbenis|Greetings my son, what are you doing here, do you want to become a monk?
dlga_jacobin_startbenis:jacobin_benirok|I have a party of soldiers, whose morale is at its lowest. They fear for their souls, can you bless them?
dlga_jacobin_benirok:jacobin_cher|Well I must not leave the cloister, but if you bring them here I can do it in my office. By the way you're in luck, our prayers are famous throughout France, thanks to the miracle that took place a long time ago near the road to the city. I ask you a sum of 400 crowns, this would greatly help our poor and our patients.
dlga_jacobin_cher:jacobinss_benirokok|It's short, but men feel much better after that, it's okay.
dlga_jacobin_cher:jacobin_predialbeniss|I do not have that kind of money.
dlga_jacobin_predialbeniss:jacobin_startbenis|What more can I do in this case?
dlga_jacobinss_benirokok:close_window|Very well, bring them to me here...
dlga_jacobin_startbenis:close_window|I leave you, father. I have to withdraw to allow myself time to think.
dlga_start:jacobin_vendstart|My friend, taste this grape. It's the best in all of France. Even if all the winemakers feel the same way of their own produce, in any case I am very proud.
dlga_jacobin_vendstart:jacobin_vendsitem|Do you produce wine?
dlga_jacobin_vendstart:close_window|I have to leave, another time perhaps.
dlga_jacobin_vendsitem:jacobin_vendsfin|Yes, wine and strong drink of very good quality. Also very good cheese we sell in the city and to the pilgrims.
dlga_jacobin_vendsfin:jacobin_vendus|I want to buy your products.
dlga_jacobin_vendsfin:jacobin_pelerins|Are there often pilgrims around here?
dlga_jacobin_vendsfin:close_window|I'm sorry, but I have to go now.
dlga_jacobin_vendus:jacobinpredialvend|But of course, look at this quality.
dlga_jacobinpredialvend:jacobin_vendsfin|Thank you my son, do you need something else?
dlga_jacobin_pelerins:jacobin_vendsfin|Every year on St. Jacques day, pilgrims from all over France start their pilgrimage towards Saint Jacques de Compostela. Many of them make a stop at our cloister. Pilgrims are recognizable from a white shell sewn on their hats. Do you want to know something else?
dlga_start:jacobinchief_start|Traveller, welcome to our cloister where good mood reigns. What can I do for you?
dlga_jacobinchief_start:jacobinchief_conffeess|Can you hear a confession, father?
dlga_jacobinchief_start:jacobinchief_help|I need help.
dlga_jacobinchief_start:close_window|No thank you, I have to leave quickly.
dlga_jacobinchief_help:jacobinchief_helpok|I would help with great pleasure, what do you require?
dlga_jacobinchief_helpok:jacobinchief_helpmedic|I need a doctor.
dlga_jacobinchief_helpok:jacobinchief_helpvend|Do you have food to sell?
dlga_jacobinchief_helpok:jacobinchief_helpbenir|A priest. May he come to bless my company?
dlga_jacobinchief_helpok:close_window|Thank you.
dlga_jacobinchief_helpmedic:jacobinchief_help|Father Michel cares for the people of the city, please contact him if you are suffering. He does his best to help the poor. Do not contact him if you do not completely meet this criteria.
dlga_jacobinchief_helpvend:jacobinchief_help|Ask father Jacques. Surely he has reservations about selling, but you will find him in the garden.
dlga_jacobinchief_helpbenir:jacobinchief_help|Contact father William, maybe he can help you.
dlga_jacobinchief_conffeess:close_window|My friend, you seem to be in a hurry. If I may ask, why such impatience, have you committed a crime?
dlga_start:quarantine_sister1|Oh my god, how did you get in?
dlga_quarantine_sister1:quarantine_dangerf|What's going on?
dlga_quarantine_sister1:close_window|Goodbye.

dlga_start:close_window.5|Get out of here, I beg you ...
dlga_start:quarantine_parlermeresup|What, why are you still here? Have you talked to the Abbess?
dlga_quarantine_parlermeresup:quarantine_soeurexpliq|Why?
dlga_quarantine_parlermeresup:close_window|I will go and talk to her.
dlga_quarantine_soeurexpliq:quarantine_question|We are contagious. A plague broke out, long ago. The inhabitants of the district are forsaken. They wanted to set fire to the Abbey to eradicate evil, but they don't dare for fear that it causes the God to get angry and expand the epidemic. 
dlga_quarantine_question:quarantine_vivres|But what do you live on?
dlga_quarantine_question:quarantineclose|I have to leave before it's too late, good luck.
dlga_quarantineclose:close_window|Pray for us, my friend.
dlga_quarantine_vivres:quarantine_mortes|Villagers bring us a daily food basket. A long time ago someone had slipped a letter inside the shopping basket. The letter said that if we didn't take the cart before nightfall it's because we're all dead, and that they would set fire to the district if that happened. For all this time we've continued to pick it up and survived, but many of our sisters have died.
dlga_quarantine_mortes:quarantine_doute|But all this time? you are all alive, the epidemic may have passed?
dlga_quarantine_mortes:close_window|I won't stay a moment longer, farewell.
dlga_quarantine_doute:close_window|You're saying the epidemic is over? It's strange, but we haven't considered that. But how to be sure? If we go out we may end up causing the death of all of the villagers. We can't take that risk.
dlga_start:quarsuit_meresupquestiong|You're back? What can we do for our friend who is not afraid of us?
dlga_quarsuit_meresupquestiong:quarsuiit_meresoinstart|I doubt you have your problems, but I am hurt, can you heal me?
dlga_quarsuit_meresupquestiong:quarsuiit_removebelesstete|I have a head injury, do something please.
dlga_quarsuit_meresupquestiong:quarsuiit_removebelessbras|I have an arm injury, can you do something?

dlga_quarsuit_meresupquestiong:close_window|I wanted to just say hello, I have to go now.
dlga_quarsuiit_meresoinstart:close_window|Of course my friend, what terrible injuries...
dlga_quarsuiit_removebelesstete:quarsuiit_removebelesstetepay|Lord! Did you know that your skull is open? We must close this horrible wound before it gets infected. It will cost you 100 crowns.
dlga_quarsuiit_removebelesstetepay:quarsuiit_removebelessteteokn|Okay, here's the money, hurry, the pain is unbearable.
dlga_quarsuiit_removebelesstetepay:quarsuiit_removebelesstetenomon|I do not have the amount you request.
dlga_quarsuiit_removebelesstetenomon:close_window|I'm sorry, but I can't do anything in this case. I can't replace these drugs if I have no money and we are so sick here.
dlga_quarsuiit_removebelessteteokn:close_window|Well, be careful next time, I will no longer see to such an injury.
dlga_quarsuiit_removebelessbras:quarsuiit_removebelessbraspay|Indeed, this is a war wound. I don't ask you which side you are, or even if you are a thief. I just ask you if you have 50 crowns to pay for care.
dlga_quarsuiit_removebelessbraspay:quarsuiit_removebelessbraspayokn|Okay, here's the money, hurry, I can barely move my arm.
dlga_quarsuiit_removebelessbraspay:quarsuiit_removebelessbraspayoknnomon|I do not have the amount you request.
dlga_quarsuiit_removebelessbraspayoknnomon:close_window|I'm sorry, but I can't do anything in this case. I can't replace these drugs if I have no money and we are so sick here.
dlga_quarsuiit_removebelessbraspayokn:close_window|Well, be careful next time, how about buying a shield?
dlga_quarsuiit_removebelessjambe:quarsuiit_removebelessjambepay|It isn't serious, however you must clean the wound and change the bandages regularly. Ointments and bandages will cost 10 crowns.
dlga_quarsuiit_removebelessjambepay:quarsuiit_removebelessjambepayokn|Okay, here's the money, hurry, I'm barely standing,
dlga_quarsuiit_removebelessjambepay:quarsuiit_removebelessjambeon|I do not have the amount you request.
dlga_quarsuiit_removebelessjambeon:close_window|I'm sorry, but I can't do anything in this case. I can't replace these drugs if I have no money and we are so sick here.
dlga_quarsuiit_removebelessjambepayokn:close_window|I recommend you to be more careful, a little rest far from fighting would make you the most good.

dlga_quarantine_bloquer:quarantine_meresoinstartcc|I could work my way in easily.

dlga_close_qurantinepeste:quarantine_crainno|I am sure you won't take any chances.
dlga_close_qurantinepeste:close_window|This is a bad idea. In fact, I think I should go.
dlga_quarantine_crainno:merequarantine_soinokokfin|Well, as you wish. I understand that you don't have a choice. I can heal you, but on one condition. We need bread, give us bread and I will check your condition.

dlga_limoge_cordier:limoge_dangeureuse|Very nice, and very dangerous I guess.
dlga_limoge_cordier:close_window|Not bad, but I have to go.
dlga_limoge_dangeureuse:limog_conaissanc|It's especially effective to down a wall that sappers have previously weakened by digging a tunnel under the foundation. They set it on fire and when the first stone hits the wall it collapses on those who were protected behind.
dlga_limog_conaissanc:ingenieurcordierfine|You seem to know siege weapons, can you give me some guidance?
dlga_limog_conaissanc:close_window|Very interesting, but I have to go.
dlga_ingenieurcordierfine:close_window|I am only tailpiece, contact the teacher for details.

dlga_limoge_accord:limoge_big_gun|Do you have any out of the ordinary weapons?
dlga_limoge_big_gun:prediallimoge_big_gun|Well... I think I can trust you, but it will take the full price. They are dangerous and powerful new weapons, you see?
dlga_prediallimoge_big_gun:limoge_accord|Thank you very much, I'd only hope that these devastating weapons will be in good hands. You see they are effective at a distance. You should try them out on a target for you to realize... do you want something else?

dlga_limoge_aprendre:limog_aprendreok|Well I can teach you the details, for 1000 crowns. What do you say?
dlga_limog_aprendreok:ingenieurcordierfineokok|Okay, here is the gold...
dlga_limog_aprendreok:close_window|I don't have 1000 crowns, I'll definitely return.
dlga_ingenieurcordierfineokok:close_window|Perfect, let's start from the beginning. For you what is the best way to cross a wall?
dlga_start:Tour_gardess1|What is there, Messire?
dlga_Tour_gardess1:tour_findtavern|I'm looking for the tavern.
dlga_Tour_gardess1:close_window|I do not want to disturb, I'm leaving.

dlga_tour_merci:close_window|Thank you my good man.
dlga_start:Tour_gardess12|I do not particularly like to train, but it is essential.

dlga_Tour_gardess12:close_window|Good luck.
dlga_tour_vivre21:tour_voleursno11|I know that sometimes I understand thieves. No need to escape to the task, they take to others!
dlga_tour_voleursno11:close_window|The fate that is reserved for thieves is not enviable in training a guard.
dlga_start:Tour_gardess13|Apologies Sir, but if you want to buy weapons, they are not for sale.
dlga_Tour_gardess13:tour_premiervue1|These are good blades at first glance.
dlga_Tour_gardess13:close_window|I'm just passing.

dlga_tours_demainss2:tourqbcpors2|Hmm... of course if you have what it takes to succeed and if you have gold. 3000 crowns will do the trick.
dlga_tourqbcpors2:tour_prixdemainss2|What can you tell me of the price?
dlga_tourqbcpors2:close_window|How much? No, I refuse.
dlga_tour_prixdemainss2:tourqbcporokoks2|Perhaps you have always desired to use a two-handed weapon on the battlefield, but you said that you wouldn't have an advantage because these weapons are too heavy. I suggest this competition to prove you wrong and offer to teach you what it takes for you to be feared throughout the country.
dlga_tourqbcporokoks2:tourtraindemainoks2|It's okay, I like that.
dlga_tourqbcporokoks2:close_window|I can not pay such a sum.
dlga_tourtraindemainoks2:tourscollleres2|Okay, start thinking about something that gets you angry.
dlga_tourscollleres2:close_window|Such as the fact of having lost 3000 crowns?
dlga_start:Tour_master_enccoorreewi3|That's it! You have beaten me! ... again, sir, I can not remain defeated before my men.
dlga_Tour_master_enccoorreewi3:tour_bonaprentisspre3|Yes, I'll give you a chance to take your revenge.
dlga_Tour_master_enccoorreewi3:close_window|I will leave you... to recover.
dlga_tour_bonaprentisspre3:tour_bonaprentiss3|This time you will not have a chance.
dlga_tour_bonaprentiss3:tours_demains3|Can you teach me how to improve my mastery of two-handed weapons ?
dlga_tour_bonaprentiss3:tour_fight3|Lets fight!
dlga_tour_bonaprentiss3:close_window|Thank you, but I have to leave now.
dlga_tour_fight3:close_window|Well, if some sprains do not scare you, I am yours.
dlga_tours_demains3:tourqbcpor3|Hmm... of course, if you have what it takes to succeed and if you have gold. 3000 crowns will do the trick.
dlga_tourqbcpor3:tour_prixdemains3|What can you tell me of the price?
dlga_tourqbcpor3:close_window|How much? No, I refuse.
dlga_tour_prixdemains3:tourqbcporokok3|Perhaps you have always desired to use a two-handed weapon on the battlefield, but you said that you wouldn't have an advantage because these weapons are too heavy.

dlga_tourqbcporokok3:tourtraindemainok3|It's okay, I like that.
dlga_tourqbcporokok3:close_window|I can not pay such a sum.
dlga_tourtraindemainok3:tourscolllere3|Okay, start thinking about something that gets you angry.
dlga_tourscolllere3:close_window|Such as the fact of having lost 3000 crowns?
dlga_start:Tour_master_startt|What can I do for you, Sir? If it is to complain of the noise of men, know that I am not their mother, I only teach them to hold a sword.
dlga_Tour_master_startt:tour_entrainementpossible|No, I was wondering if you could train me too.
dlga_Tour_master_startt:close_window|I have to leave.
dlga_tour_entrainementpossible:tour_bonaprentis|It depends ... if you have the right skills, I can help you perfect them, but I'm not here to show you how to pull a sword out of its sheathe.
dlga_tour_bonaprentis:tours_demains|Can you teach me how to improve my mastery of two-handed weapons ?
dlga_tour_bonaprentis:tour_fight|Let's fight!
dlga_tour_bonaprentis:close_window|Thank you, but I have to leave now.
dlga_tour_fight:close_window|Well, if some sprains do not scare you, I am yours.
dlga_tours_demains:tourqbcpor|Hmm... of course, if you have what it takes to succeed and if you have gold. 3000 crowns will do the trick.
dlga_tourqbcpor:tour_prixdemains|What can you tell me about the price?

dlga_tourtraindemainok:tourscolllere|Okay, start thinking about something that gets you angry.
dlga_tourscolllere:close_window|Such as the fact of having lost 3000 crowns?
dlga_start:tour_partir|Attention, back off or risk getting your throat slit.
dlga_tour_partir:close_window|Pay a little attention.
dlga_start:tourtraingorge|Back, My lord.
dlga_tourtraingorge:close_window|Pay a little attention.
dlga_start:lyon_master_enccoorreess2|So it is too fast?
dlga_lyon_master_enccoorreess2:lyon_bonaprentissloosspre2|I'll get there, I know it.
dlga_lyon_master_enccoorreess2:close_window|I think ... it will go
dlga_lyon_bonaprentissloosspre2:lyon_bonaprentissloosspre22|I wish you good luck.
dlga_lyon_bonaprentissloosspre22:lyon_demainss2|Can you teach me how to improve my mastery of one-handed swords and shields at the same time?
dlga_lyon_bonaprentissloosspre22:lyon_fights2|En garde!
dlga_lyon_bonaprentissloosspre22:close_window|Thank you, but I have to leave now.
dlga_lyon_fights2:close_window|That's it ...
dlga_lyon_demainss2:lyonqbcpors2|Want to know how Border Guards of Lyon are able to be untouchable and to respond as fast, huh? Well I can teach you some moves for 3000 crowns, okay?
dlga_lyonqbcpors2:lyon_prixdemainss2|What can you tell me about the price?
dlga_lyonqbcpors2:close_window|How much? No, I refuse.
dlga_lyon_prixdemainss2:lyonqbcporokoks2|Well, some will tell you that the best weapon is the spear or the hammer, or a covered jug of dung. Send them to hell. The only valid war weapons are a sword and a shield. I can teach you to handle both at the same time effectively. All that remains is to cut armor and beggars that are there. For balance the hammer or the Bec de Corbin are not bad.
dlga_lyonqbcporokoks2:lyontraindemainoks2|It's okay, I want to be quick!
dlga_lyonqbcporokoks2:close_window|I can not pay such a sum.
dlga_lyontraindemainoks2:lyonscollleres2|Okay, you have to start to realize that you have two arms. One defends another attacks... and you only have to think about defense when you attack, while thinking of the attack when you defend.
dlga_lyonscollleres2:close_window|I think I got the trick.
dlga_start:lyon_master_enccoorreewi3|Fuck, fucking beggar. How did you succeed? If it was on the battlefield I'd be dead, yet... do not stay on a defeat.
dlga_lyon_master_enccoorreewi3:lyon_bonaprentisspre3|Yes, I will allow you your chance at revenge.
dlga_lyon_master_enccoorreewi3:close_window|I can not waste any more time ... sorry about your own love.

dlga_lyonscolllere3:close_window|I think I got the trick.
dlga_start:lyon_master_startt|Greetings, what are you doing in the barracks? The tavern is not on this side, you know.
dlga_lyon_master_startt:lyon_entrainementpossible|I was wondering if you could to train me with the sword and shield.
dlga_lyon_master_startt:close_window|I take the road to the tavern in this case, farewell.
dlga_lyon_entrainementpossible:lyon_bonaprentis|Well ... why not, what technique are you lacking now?
dlga_lyon_bonaprentis:lyon_demains|Can you teach me how to improve my mastery of one-handed swords and shields at the same time?
dlga_lyon_bonaprentis:lyon_fight|Let's fight!
dlga_lyon_bonaprentis:close_window|Thank you, but I have to leave now.
dlga_lyon_fight:close_window|If you want to take shots I know how to stop you... well, try to follow me.
dlga_lyon_demains:lyonqbcpor|Want to know how Border Guards of Lyon are able to be untouchable and to respond as fast, huh? Well I can teach you some moves for 3000 crowns, okay?
dlga_lyonqbcpor:lyon_prixdemains|What can you tell me about the price?
dlga_lyonqbcpor:close_window|The price of a king's ransom? Farewell, it is not ok.
dlga_lyon_prixdemains:lyonqbcporokok|Well, some will tell you that the best weapon is the spear or the hammer, or a covered jug of dung. Send them to hell.

dlga_lyonqbcporokok:lyontraindemainok|That's okay, could you be about?
dlga_lyonqbcporokok:close_window|I can not pay such a sum.
dlga_lyontraindemainok:lyontraindemainok2|Okay, you have to start to realize that you have two arms. One defends another attacks... and you only have to think about defense when you attack, while thinking of the attack when you defend.
dlga_lyontraindemainok2:close_window|I think I got the trick...
dlga_start:lyyon_partir|Watch Out! What are you doing in our legs?
dlga_lyyon_partir:close_window|My apologies.
dlga_start:lyyon_partir2|Back
dlga_lyyon_partir2:close_window|Pay a little attention.
dlga_start:lyon_senti|Do not approach a man who stands guard without making noises, please.
dlga_lyon_senti:close_window|My apologies.
dlga_start:lyon_gardedeentre|Sir? Is it a visit, or do you have a message for the captain?
dlga_lyon_gardedeentre:close_window|Rather, it is a visit to this case, but I will not stay long.
dlga_start:lyon_tav_caserne|What are you doing here? It's a fire you know? While this may look like a tavern.
dlga_lyon_tav_caserne:close_window|Well, I'm going.
dlga_start:orleans_maitre|Greetings, if you are here for an order, please talk to the master.
dlga_orleans_maitre:orleans_dialmaitre|What do you think of the master?
dlga_orleans_maitre:close_window|I'm leaving immediately.
dlga_orleans_dialmaitre:close_window|Master is not a bad guy. He certainly doesn't miss an opportunity to snub me in public, but it's to remind everyone who is the master blacksmith and who is the apprentice.
dlga_start:orleans_vendeur12|Welcome to my humble abode, what can I do for you?
dlga_orleans_vendeur12:orleans_vendeurgo|Such modesty, there seems to everything you'd need to equip an army.
dlga_orleans_vendeur1:orleans_dialvendeur1j|Master, I want to see your works.
dlga_orleans_vendeur1:close_window|I have to go but I'll be back.
dlga_orleans_vendeurgo:orleans_vendeur1|I pay particular attention to the quality. My blades are forged from the purest steel. It takes a steady hand and the knowledge of a master blacksmith to get such results.
dlga_orleans_vendeurpredial:orleans_vendeur1|Anything else?
dlga_orleans_dialvendeur1j:orleans_vendeurpredial|Admire this quality, my lord.
dlga_start:bordeau_banner1|Approach, My lord. Do you wish to buy a new banner? A moment, forgive me, but is there a possibility that you aren't a noble after all? In any case have a look, but know that I refuse to make a noble banner for someone who is not one, you probably know that it's forbidden. I wouldn't put myself up for public shaming.
dlga_bordeau_banner1:bordeau_banner_vend|Of course I am noble. Show me your banners, artisan.
dlga_bordeau_banner1:Bordeau_banimpression|And if I was not noble and I wanted a banner anyway, just to impress my troupe of mercenaries, what would happen?
dlga_bordeau_banner1:close_window|Do not worry, it doesn't interest me anyway.
dlga_bordeau_banner_vend:bordeau_banner_vendmoney|It's perfect, My Lord. Let me show you my creations. It will cost 150 crowns and you can be sure of the quality.
dlga_Bordeau_banimpression:close_window|Oh my god, I would risk not having the right to exercise my profession if it was ever known. I refuse. Go now or I will call the guards.
dlga_bordeau_banner_vendmoney:bordeau_fin_banniere|Here's the gold, show me the banners now.
dlga_bordeau_banner_vendmoney:close_window|I do not have 150 crowns to spend on a damn banner.
dlga_bordeau_fin_banniere:close_window|You will not be disappointed, I guarantee you.
dlga_start:bordeau_vendsom|My Lord, here... do you want a fresh, good ale? Or do you want to try my wine? I can get plenty more if you wish so.
dlga_bordeau_vendsom:bordeau_vendsom2|Great idea, let me see.
dlga_bordeau_vendsom:close_window|I have enough already, but thank you.
dlga_bordeau_vendsom2:predialbordeau_vendsom2|But of course, go ahead.
dlga_predialbordeau_vendsom2:bordeau_vendsom|Thank you my friend, do you need something else?
dlga_start:destinat_bordeaud|Want to buy my books?
dlga_destinat_bordeaud:destinat_bordeaud2|No, I bring you cargo from the Guild of Messengers.
dlga_destinat_bordeaud2:destinat_bordeaud2ou|Very well, is this it?
dlga_destinat_bordeaud2ou:close_window|Here it is.
dlga_destinat_bordeaud2ou:destinat_bordeaud2oufail|Well, I lost it.
dlga_destinat_bordeaud2oufail:close_window|How?! How could you misplace such a big box? Get lost.
dlga_start:bdestinat_bordeaud|Want to buy my books?
dlga_bdestinat_bordeaud:bdestinat_bordeaud2|No, I bring you cargo from the Guild of Messengers.
dlga_bdestinat_bordeaud2:bdestinat_bordeaud2ou|Thank you my friend, do you need something else?
dlga_bdestinat_bordeaud2ou:close_window|Here it is.
dlga_bdestinat_bordeaud2ou:bdestinat_bordeaud2oufail|Well, I lost it.
dlga_bdestinat_bordeaud2oufail:close_window|How?! How could you misplace such a big box? Get lost.
dlga_start:ddestinat_bordeaud|Want to buy my books?
dlga_ddestinat_bordeaud:ddestinat_bordeaud2|No, I bring you cargo from the Guild of Messengers.
dlga_ddestinat_bordeaud2:ddestinat_bordeaud2ou|Thank you my friend, do you need something else?
dlga_ddestinat_bordeaud2ou:close_window|Here it is.
dlga_ddestinat_bordeaud2ou:ddestinat_bordeaud2oufail|Well, I lost it.
dlga_ddestinat_bordeaud2oufail:close_window|How?! How could you misplace such a big box? Get lost.
dlga_start:mdestinat_bordeaud|Want to buy my books?
dlga_mdestinat_bordeaud:mdestinat_bordeaud2|No, I bring you cargo from the Guild of Messengers.
dlga_mdestinat_bordeaud2:mdestinat_bordeaud2ou|Thank you my friend, do you need something else?
dlga_mdestinat_bordeaud2ou:close_window|Here it is.
dlga_mdestinat_bordeaud2ou:mdestinat_bordeaud2oufail|Well, I lost it.
dlga_mdestinat_bordeaud2oufail:close_window|How?! How could you misplace such a big box? Get lost.
dlga_start:bordeau_vendlivreapres|Hello, is that you?
dlga_bordeau_vendlivreapres:bordeau_donncressourc2plusressour|The Archangel Gabriel is hungry.
dlga_bordeau_vendlivreapres:bordeau_vendlivre2apre|I would like a book
dlga_bordeau_vendlivreapres:close_window|I am better at doing than reading.
dlga_bordeau_vendlivre2apre:predialbordeau_vendlivre2aprrs|Very good. Buy it and leave, please.
dlga_predialbordeau_vendlivre2aprrs:bordeau_vendlivreapres|Now go, I risk my life.
dlga_bordeau_donncressourc2plusressour:close_window|Very funny, really. Listen, the rebels have made me a favor and now we're even. Buy my book or disappear... look out, talk something else quickly.
dlga_start:bordeau_vendlivre|Ha... finally someone who can read. Want to buy one of my books? I have a fabulous collection and unbeatable prices.
dlga_bordeau_vendlivre:bordeau_donncressourc2|They told me to tell you that the Archangel Gabriel is hungry.
dlga_bordeau_vendlivre:bordeau_vendlivre2|Let me see, I might be interested.
dlga_bordeau_vendlivre:close_window|I am better at doing than reading.
dlga_bordeau_vendlivre2:predialbordeau_vendlivre2|Do you see yourself?
dlga_predialbordeau_vendlivre2:bordeau_vendlivre|Thanks, will you take another?
dlga_bordeau_donncressourc2:close_window|Well... I expected you, look, we're even now.
dlga_start:bordeau_potiersvend|Come closer! Pottery, bowls, soup bowls, glasses...
dlga_bordeau_potiersvend:bordeau_potiersvend2|What would I do with your pottery?
dlga_bordeau_potiersvend:close_window|No, thank you.
dlga_bordeau_potiersvend2:predialbordeau_potiersvend22|I don't know. If it wasn't for a household, you could always sell the most expensive ones elsewhere if you travel a lot.
dlga_predialbordeau_potiersvend22:bordeau_potiersvend23|This is perhaps a good idea, if the price is right. Show me your wares.
dlga_predialbordeau_potiersvend22:close_window|I have better things to do than to burden me with all this muck.
dlga_bordeau_potiersvend23:predialbordeau_potiersvend2|You make an excellent point, My Lord. You see, the artisans are still cheaper than wholesalers.
dlga_predialbordeau_potiersvend2:bordeau_potiersvend|Thank you very much, do you want more?
dlga_start:provencecapitaine2|Ready to depart?
dlga_provencecapitaine2:close_window|Yes, let's go quickly.
dlga_provencecapitaine2:close_window.1|Not yet.
dlga_start:provencecapitainecondition2hh|We are leaving soon, so go talk to the passengers.
dlga_provencecapitainecondition2hh:close_window|Very well.
dlga_start:provencecapitainecondition2|We are leaving soon, so go talk to the passengers.
dlga_provencecapitainecondition2:close_window|Very well.
dlga_start:provencecapitaine|Welcome traveller, find your place among all this mess if you want to get to Dijon. It'll cost 50 crowns.
dlga_provencecapitaine:provence_capitaine_partirdebut|Okay, here's the money ...
dlga_provencecapitaine:close_capitaine1|Merde! I don't have enough.
dlga_close_capitaine1:close_window|No money, no trip. My condolences, find a solution or you stay here.
dlga_provence_capitaine_partirdebut:close_debutvoyage_1|It's perfect, we set off right now, are you ready?
dlga_provence_capitaine_partirdebut:close_window|We leave soon, stay around...
dlga_provence_capitaine_partirdebut:close_window.1|Do not stay in my way, we're not ready, go to the bridge ...
dlga_close_debutvoyage_1:close_window|Yes, let's go quickly.
dlga_close_debutvoyage_1:close_window.1|Not yet, I have something to do.
dlga_start:provence_paysan_1|Greetings... just taking a small break. Getting right back to work, I promise!
dlga_provence_paysan_1:provence_paysan_1playerz|Easy, I'm not your landlord.
dlga_provence_paysan_1playerz:provence_paysan_1z|Do you have something to eat?
dlga_provence_paysan_1:close_window|I have to go.
dlga_provence_paysan_1z:provence_paysan_1zfin|Of course, I make bread and cheese. Take your pick.
dlga_provence_paysan_1zfin:close_window|Thank you and my apologies, but I've got work to do.
dlga_start:provence_vendeur_2|Approach, traveller. I sell weapons, do you see my coffers? I have some quality pieces.
dlga_provence_vendeur_2:provence_vendeur_2ok|I knew it as soon as I saw a man doubling as a weapons rack.
dlga_provence_vendeur_2:close_window|Moment, I need to check my purse.
dlga_provence_vendeur_2ok:provence_vendeur_2end|Sure... you know, these days it's foolish to travel unarmed. I reckon the longer the blade, the more it will impress all sorts of brigands.
dlga_provence_vendeur_2end:close_window|Thank you, I hope the journey won't be too long.
dlga_start:provence_vendeur_3|Fresh horses for your travel to Dijon.
dlga_provence_vendeur_3:provence_vendeur_3ok|These horses look nice.
dlga_provence_vendeur_3:close_window|My purse is empty, I have to think twice before buying anything.
dlga_provence_vendeur_3ok:provence_vendeur_3end|See for yourself, my lord, they come ready and willing.
dlga_provence_vendeur_3end:close_window|At your service.
dlga_start:provence_notrahison|A long journey awaits us, I'll get some sleep and hope that you won't betray us.
dlga_provence_notrahison:close_window|You can rest easy.
dlga_start:provence_rebel_3|Hey! Comrade, come closer.
dlga_provence_rebel_3:provence_debut_quete|Another thief, what would you say to a swim to the river bottom?
dlga_provence_debut_quete:find_bourgg|You misunderstand me, friend. My name is Michel and I'm just a traveller like you walking towards his destiny, are you French? You're ... a merchant?
dlga_find_bourgg:haha_provenc|Are you Burgundian?
dlga_haha_provenc:find_bourgasg|Ha ha... I like you, traveller. Are you aware of the situation in France, or have you been cut out from the rest of the world in your little village? Let me tell you this: You think you're safe from war in the hinterlands, but one day the English will come and set your house on fire. They will kill anyone who resists and violate their women, then they drink and do it again. Frenchman taking a boat to Burgundy should know what to expect out there.
dlga_find_bourgasg:prov_guerre|War?
dlga_prov_guerre:find_chairr1|War? Yes, she has a hundred faces; that of a crying child, that of a man begging his torturer and that of a man who has no face, mutilated deep in his flesh.
dlga_find_chairr1:find_rejoindre|The worst in all this is that those who hold the spear, the nobles, they have no share in this suffering. They stuff themselves playing a war, always sending the poor devils to be massacred, and if they don't agree they are killed on the spot.
dlga_find_rejoindre:prov_rejoindrejeanne|If your goal was to spoil my trip, you succeeded.
dlga_prov_rejoindrejeanne:find_montpeliergo|You think you are ready for combat, but believe me you're not. There is hope, have you heard about Joan of Lorraine? Says she was sent by God to save us. The people rebelled and gathered under her orders near occupied cities and began to organize. I am part of a gathering of fellows. You seem trustworthy so I'll tell you that we are gathering in the ruins of the Tower of the Pines in Montpellier. Join us! This is your only chance of salvation. We need each other, believe me, and if you don't have faith - no fear, you will be paid for your help. So, are you going to go to Montpellier, comrade?
dlga_find_montpeliergo:close_finfleuve|Very well, I'll go and see your friends when I get near Montpellier.
dlga_find_montpeliergo:close_window|Not interested, sorry.
dlga_close_finfleuve:close_window|That's good to hear. You'll see, and thrive among us, comrade...
dlga_start:provence_wherecapitaine|Welcome aboard. Do not forget to pay. The captain has already thrown travellers overboard because they didn't. I assure you, I saw with my own eyes.
dlga_provence_wherecapitaine:close_wherecapitaine|Where can I find the captain?
dlga_provence_wherecapitaine:close_window|Thank you for your guidance, friend. Farewell.
dlga_close_wherecapitaine:close_window|On the upper deck. I suggest caution, he's angry.
dlga_start:provence_to_Dijon|Why are you going to Dijon, if I can ask you this question?
dlga_provence_to_Dijon:provence_to_Dijon_fin|I am a man of arms, and I will join the fights further north, that's where I belong.
dlga_provence_to_Dijon:provence_to_Dijon_fin.1|I need to go to Dijon, I have to visit a dying aunt.
dlga_provence_to_Dijon:close_window|You can not.
dlga_provence_to_Dijon_fin:close_window|I hope that the trip will go well, I heard rumors that the river is infested with pirates.
dlga_start:sanglysbatdormrr_1|Finally I can get some sleep before the next battle.
dlga_sanglysbatdormrr_1:close_window|Best idea of the day.
dlga_start:sanglysbateau_1|Hello adventurer, are you a mercenary?
dlga_sanglysbateau_1:sanglysmercenairebat|Indeed, I am a mercenary.
dlga_sanglysbateau_1:sanglysno_mercenairebat|Not really, I'm on a different path.
dlga_sanglysmercenairebat:sanglysmercenairhqcompagn|I thought so. What company do you belong to?
dlga_sanglysno_mercenairebat:slys_payehseifgneur|Well, if you are ever short of crowns, know that the company of Freelancers recruits in the city of Bourges. Barracks is at the Gordaine Square. Their admission tests are very hard, but they pay like lords.
dlga_slys_payehseifgneur:close_window|Thank you, I'll remember.
dlga_sanglysmercenairhqcompagn:sanglysmercenairhqcompagnh2|I'm not in a company currently.
dlga_sanglysmercenairhqcompagnh2:sanglysmercenairchanccsgord|I am in a great company, they are fighting at the moment and are recruiting. You should go to Bourges and pass the admission test. Beware, they are demanding, but the pay is good. If you want to try your luck their barracks is on Gordaine square.
dlga_sanglysmercenairchanccsgord:sanglysmercenairhqcompagnhendd|Okay, I will pass their test, thank you.
dlga_sanglysmercenairchanccsgord:close_window|Thanks, but I don't want to get in a company.
dlga_sanglysmercenairhqcompagnhendd:close_window|Good luck friend.
dlga_start:anger_banner1|Approach, My lord. Do you wish to buy a new banner? A moment, forgive me, but is there a possibility that you aren't a noble after all? In any case have a look, but know that I refuse to make a noble banner for someone who is not one, you probably know that it's forbidden. I wouldn't put myself up for public shaming.
dlga_anger_banner1:anger_banner_vend|Of course I am noble. Show me your banners, artisan.
dlga_anger_banner1:anger_banimpression|If I wasn't and I wanted a banner to just impress my squad of mercenaries, what would you do?
dlga_anger_banner1:close_window|Do not worry, it doesn't interest me anyway.
dlga_anger_banner_vend:anger_banner_vendmoney|It's perfect, My Lord. Let me show you my creations. It will cost 150 crowns and you can be sure of the quality.
dlga_anger_banimpression:close_window|Dear God, I'd lose the right to exercise my profession if it ever came known. If you refuse to leave, I'll call the guard.
dlga_anger_banner_vendmoney:anger_fin_banniere|Here's the gold, show me banners now.
dlga_anger_banner_vendmoney:close_window|Here's 150 crowns, show me the banners.
dlga_anger_fin_banniere:close_window|You will not be disappointed, I guarantee you.
dlga_start:ducale_guardstart1|Hey! What are you doing here? Go away.
dlga_ducale_guardstart1:ducale_guardstartwho|Who lives in this castle?
dlga_ducale_guardstart1:ducale_guardqueteok|I have an invitation to the banquet with me, I want to enter.
dlga_ducale_guardstart1:close_window|Do not mind, I'm just passing through.
dlga_ducale_guardstartwho:close_window|If you don't know, you have no business being here. Disappear, dirty thief!
dlga_ducale_guardqueteok:close_window|Show me... everything is in order, My Lord. You can enter.
dlga_start:ducale_monss|My lord
dlga_ducale_monss:close_window|At ease.
dlga_start:ducale_monss2|Have a good time.
dlga_ducale_monss2:close_window|Pretty armor.
dlga_start:ducale_comte|But... who're you?
dlga_ducale_comte:start_epic_battlecomte|Don't you hear the voices of the innocent that you massacred? I am their avenging arm.
dlga_ducale_comte:close_window|I won't make excuses, dear Count. Urgent business, remember?
dlga_start_epic_battlecomte:close_window|Lord no! A rebel... rebel!!
dlga_start:ducale_monss3|Greetings, My lord.
dlga_ducale_monss3:close_window|Thank you.
dlga_start:ducale_monss4|My respects, My lord.
dlga_ducale_monss4:close_window|...
dlga_start:ducale_attentarm|Well, don't take this the wrong way My Lord, but... I suggest exercising caution with your new weapon.
dlga_ducale_attentarm:close_window|No fear.
dlga_start:ducale_armurier|My lord? What... what can I do for you in our humble barracks?
dlga_ducale_armurier:caen_ou_comte_1|Where is the count?
dlga_ducale_armurier:caen_donnerarme|I fear of a rebel attack, could you give me a weapon? I would feel much better.
dlga_ducale_armurier:close_window|Nothing, I am completely lost.
dlga_caen_donnerarme:caen_armechoix|But certainly, My Lord. What would you like? A dagger perhaps?
dlga_caen_armechoix:arbalete_ok_caen|I know nothing about weapons. I'm more used to holding a pen, but a crossbow or a sword should be enough to reassure me.
dlga_arbalete_ok_caen:close_window|An excellent choice. My Lord... and you say that you've never seen a gun? You are surely gifted in all disciplines. The best place to hold is here.
dlga_caen_ou_comte_1:ducale_armurier|The Count is in his apartments at the top of the castle. I have not seen him down and that's the only way, do you want something else?
dlga_start:ducale_monssair|My Lord, a little fresh air won't hurt, am I right?
dlga_ducale_monssair:close_caenrebelz|Do you fear an attack by the rebels?
dlga_close_caenrebelz:caen_bonsoldat|No, not at all. Believe in my experience, they won't come into the city to attack us with wooden forks, ha ha... over here we have very good soldiers.
dlga_caen_bonsoldat:close_window|If they are all as quick-witted as you, I'm reassured.
dlga_start:ducale_monss11|My respects, Mister.
dlga_ducale_monss11:close_window|...
dlga_start:ducale_monss12|My respects, Mister.
dlga_ducale_monss12:close_window|Thank you... well, I mean... nothing.
dlga_start:ducale_monss1z|My respects, My lord.
dlga_ducale_monss1z:close_window|...
dlga_start:ducale_monss1s|My respects, My lord.
dlga_ducale_monss1s:close_window|...
dlga_start:ducale_paren|Sincerely, dear friend. Are you related to the Count?
dlga_ducale_paren:close_window|Well... no, I must leave you.
dlga_start:ducale_comtedeadd|So... the bastard died?
dlga_ducale_comtedeadd:ducale_comtfuitt|We can't have more death, leave quickly.
dlga_ducale_comtfuitt:close_window|Shit, how do we proceed?
dlga_start:ducale_rebelbatar|So... the bastard died?
dlga_ducale_rebelbatar:close_caenechec|I can't go back, the mission... is a failure.
dlga_close_caenechec:close_window|Shit, how do we proceed?
dlga_start:ducale_convivboir|These banquets are so boring, we only drink, eat and drink again...
dlga_ducale_convivboir:caen_enuyy|I admit to having very little chance to get bored.
dlga_caen_enuyy:close_window|What do you mean? A trait of mind that I do not understand, it's too bad, it could've brightened up this evening...
dlga_start:ducale_franceang|France will soon belong to England.
dlga_ducale_franceang:jeanne_caen_nouv|News from the front?
dlga_jeanne_caen_nouv:close_window|This peasant witch continues to provoke revolt. This is unacceptable. We should summon an assassin no matter the cost.
dlga_start:ducale_comerce|Are you here for trading or something else?
dlga_ducale_comerce:caen_nbiens|...and you, I figure from your looks that you are the most skilful merchant of us all. Do you have many goods?
dlga_caen_nbiens:close_window|Oh, oh... you guessed right, My Lord. I have many stables, we also manufacture boats. This evening seems good advertisement.
dlga_start:ducale_ivre|Couldn't be.
dlga_ducale_ivre:caen_vii|How is the wine, sir?
dlga_caen_vii:close_window|Hen, come back.
dlga_start:ducale_chevalier|Sir, I'm afraid we've seen the end of chivalry. Earlier we were fighting on equal terms to serve our good law. How will this war end, I ask you?
dlga_ducale_chevalier:caen_gentil|Sometimes it's offered by a real gentleman knight, whatever his side.
dlga_caen_gentil:caen_assur|Ha! ... and that gentleman knight, you've encountered one?
dlga_caen_assur:close_window|Surely...
dlga_start:pin_sepiasser|You can pass.
dlga_pin_sepiasser:pin_sepiasser2|You're doing a great job, friend.
dlga_pin_sepiasser2:close_window|That's about it, laugh at me!
dlga_start:pin_sentend|I do not trust you, in spite of everything, so keep your hands away from your weapons.
dlga_pin_sentend:close_window|I'll remember.
dlga_start:pin_sent1|Stop! Who are you and what are you doing here?
dlga_pin_sent1:pin_welcom|Michel sent me here to meet your leader.
dlga_pin_welcom:close_window|Ah! Very good, you can go comrade.
dlga_start:pin_mmaarr|I'm tired of all this.
dlga_pin_mmaarr:pinss_partirsimpl1|You only have to do that, it's simple.
dlga_pinss_partirsimpl1:close_window|Leave my companions? Where are do you taking me?
dlga_start:pin_maarais1|So we came to get bogged down in the marshes?
dlga_pin_maarais1:pinss_maarais1|How are things here?
dlga_pinss_maarais1:close_window|Bad, very bad. We are starving. There is game around here, but not much else. I do not fear the English, because it's the hunger that will defeat us.
dlga_start:pin_reprep1|A little rest won't hurt.
dlga_pin_reprep1:ploincoupe|Of what use am I to you at this point?
dlga_ploincoupe:close_window|...and who cuts the wood after you, huh?
dlga_start:pin_mzzis1|Hello friend, what's your name?
dlga_pin_mzzis1:pineeis1|I'm {playername}.
dlga_pineeis1:close_window|Welcome {playername}, find yourself a nice and dry place and do not worry, you won't be bothered. There are no bad guys here.
dlga_start:pin_flottd1|I need to drink, this rain makes me thirsty.
dlga_pin_flottd1:close_window|You only have to drink water from the marshes.
dlga_start:pin_find1|How are you?
dlga_pin_find1:pin_find1e|A little wet... where is your leader?
dlga_pin_find1e:close_window|You mean our chief? He's at the top of the tower as always. I hope he's looking for a way to get us something to eat.
dlga_start:pin_haut|Hello there.
dlga_pin_haut:pin_hautd|Where's the chief?
dlga_pin_hautd:close_window|At the top of the tower.
dlga_start:pin_arbamurapres|Greetings
dlga_pin_arbamurapres:pinsclose|Greetings, still drafty?
dlga_pinsclose:close_window|Yes, but you who stay down you risk a lot more than me. You know it's strange but it's been a while since I came down from this tower.
dlga_start:pin_arbamur|Greetings
dlga_pin_arbamur:pin_arbamurdd|Greetings, I heard you give out bounties to mercenaries, that's about it.
dlga_pin_arbamurdd:close_window|Soon... Ha, ha, ha, ha!
dlga_start:pin_mercicaseg|Thank you for everything, comrade.
dlga_pin_mercicaseg:close_window|It was easy.
dlga_start:pin_arbamurdd11|Nice to see a new face. Please, speak to the chief.
dlga_pin_arbamurdd11:close_window|Very well.
dlga_start:dern_dialchefpi|{playername}, it's always a pleasure to see you. How are you?
dlga_dern_dialchefpi:dern_dialchefpi2|I can get ... and you?
dlga_dern_dialchefpi2:close_window|Its ok as it is, even if it's not always easy.
dlga_start:plis_toulnot|Back? How was Burgundy?
dlga_plis_toulnot:plis_toulnot2|I went to Toul, but the rebels are gone. I found this note, but it seems coded.
dlga_plis_toulnot2:plis_toulnot3|Let me see...
dlga_plis_toulnot3:plis_toulnot4|Yes, that's about it. It's a fairly simple but indecipherable code in the case we need to leave directions on the ground. The Burgundian rebels say they have to move. They are hiding in the Verzy forest, near Reims. You know what remains to be done.
dlga_plis_toulnot4:plis_toulnot5|Why the change of place and why make me go all this way?
dlga_plis_toulnot5:close_window|No idea, you ask them. Good luck.
dlga_start:noplis_toulnot|Back? How was Burgundy?
dlga_noplis_toulnot:noplis_toulnot2|I didn't find rebels at Toul, they have left the area.
dlga_noplis_toulnot2:close_window|Well, the forests are the best places to stay concealed while being close enough to the enemy. You should look in the forests near the Burgundian cities, Reims and Metz seem to be perfect places.
dlga_start:reb_toulnotway|Good to see you mate! You seem fine, how was Toul?
dlga_reb_toulnotway:reb_toulnotway2|I haven't left yet, other urgent matters hold me.
dlga_reb_toulnotway2:close_window|Do your best and you'll always be welcome at camp.
dlga_start:reb_toulgo|This is great, comrade. We finally found our way. After all these years going in circles at the camps, being chased by the English patrols. We now know what to do. Attacking convoys and camps help to thwart the general Anglo-Burgundian strategy to settle in the south. You've been great but you're of no further use to us here, we will work this out. The rebels who operate in Burgundy are currently having more problems than we and they need men. I sent some guys there. You should join them. They settled in the deserted village of Toul, south of Metz.
dlga_reb_toulgo:reb_toulgo2|This village was decimated by the plague, but don't worry. There's no risk, it's long gone. Find them and ask them what they need, if you still want to serve the cause. Some say that the village is haunted, which makes it perfect for hiding... I hope that you are a good addition.
dlga_reb_toulgo2:reb_toulgook|Okay, I oppose the English, so I'll go to the village of Toul.
dlga_reb_toulgo2:close_window|I can't tell whether your cause is the path I want to follow.
dlga_reb_toulgook:close_window|I don't know what to give you for your help as I possess nothing, but I'll gladly offer my horse. It's a very good horse. May God protect you.
dlga_start:cour_demolicampeng|So have you razed the camp?
dlga_cour_demolicampeng:cour_demolicampeng2|This is done, they are no more.
dlga_cour_demolicampeng2:close_window|I'm struggling to believe it. Finally we have achieved something! We must continue our action, comrade. Do not release the pressure and stay strong in difficult times. Now I need time to think, and... thank you again.
dlga_start:cour_failldemolicampeng|So have you razed the camp?
dlga_cour_failldemolicampeng:cour_failldemolicampeng2|No, we have been defeated, I am sorry.
dlga_cour_failldemolicampeng2:close_window|Damn, just when you start to get by. It's not your fault, I am sure you have done your best, maybe they are too strong at the moment. Leave me alone I have to think this over, comrade.
dlga_start:cour_dataquecampenglishlish|So have you razed the camp?
dlga_cour_dataquecampenglishlish:close_window|Not yet, but we will take care of it.
dlga_cour_dataquecampenglishlish:cour_dataquecampenglishlishfail|I'm sorry, comrade. I can't take care of that.
dlga_cour_dataquecampenglishlishfail:close_window|I can't force you, right? But think about the fact that if we do not act, the Englishmen will be at our doors soon, and it will dictate the way in which you will have to live. I'm not going to talk about the other things that will happen...
dlga_start:canglais_batpretpuy|Ready for the future, comrade?
dlga_canglais_batpretpuy:canglais_batpretpuy2|Follow?
dlga_canglais_batpretpuy:close_window|Not now, I'm pretty tired...
dlga_canglais_batpretpuy2:canglais_batpretpuy3|We have food, we have weapons and we oppose the invaders. What more is needed before we can finally move to action? My plan is to win the enemy by discouraging them, to the point where the Regent of England says he no longer wants anything to do with France. Then they will come and pick up the soldiers, throw them in a boat and they all disappear.
dlga_canglais_batpretpuy3:canglais_batpretpuy4|I suppose even you have suffered because of this war.
dlga_canglais_batpretpuy4:canglais_batpretpuy5|No do not get me wrong, even if I have lost loved ones in this war, I do not like unless France and I work only for her own good. Before the fighting, I was the Guild Master in a quiet town. You know what happened out there? The English besieged us. We informed them of our capitulation, but were caught in a fury caused by their last battle that ended in a failure. They burned everything and killed everyone except those who were able to escape. Fortunately I was one of them. You see, people aspire to a quiet life and that requires not getting beat up. We are at peril because it's impossible to live with the Englishmen.
dlga_canglais_batpretpuy5:canglais_batpretpuy6|What will you do then?
dlga_canglais_batpretpuy6:canglais_batpretpuy7|A vanguard was discovered by one of our patrols not far from the castle Puy, a few miles from there. It's evident that the Englishmen intend to besiege the castle to ensure a base of operations in our sector. They probably expect the public to denounce the position of the rebels. I think the plan is to move in and conquer the south of France in due time. We desperately need to weaken their grip on the region so they'll have no choice but to fall back to Guyenne. At least for a moment they are not expected to make a move. Can you take care of this, comrade?
dlga_canglais_batpretpuy7:canglais_batpretpuy7ok|I'm not opposed to the idea of working against the English, indefinitely. 
dlga_canglais_batpretpuy7:close_window|Your cause brings me nothing and I need gold, I'll see the camp later.
dlga_canglais_batpretpuy7ok:canglais_batpretpuy7ok2|We thank you. The camp where they gather is located near the castle Puy, I'll mark it on your map. The operation is not very complicated, they should not expect us. Stay together and attack small groups. That should even things out with them having better training, equipment and experience. I'll ask other groups to join. Don't worry, we will have enough people, but we must act quickly before they receive reinforcements.
dlga_canglais_batpretpuy7ok2:canglais_batpretpuy7ok3|Ok, I'm going to head there.
dlga_canglais_batpretpuy7ok3:close_window|Good luck and be valiant in battle. May God accompany you.
dlga_start:pin_2ggg3cpassecovoyi|So how did it go with the convoy?
dlga_pin_2ggg3cpassecovoyi:pins_f31maluuse|We got them!
dlga_pins_f31maluuse:close_window|What? I can't believe my ears, ha ha! This is a great victory for the rebellion, believe me. Celebrate it like one and we see later for the rest. I see you have kept some weapons from the convoy. Keep them with you, they are well earned! See you later okay? Let me enjoy this victory.
dlga_start:pin_2cparrssecovoyi|So how did it go with the convoy?
dlga_pin_2cparrssecovoyi:pins_2mffaluuse|Slightly wrong.
dlga_pins_2mffaluuse:close_window|Slightly wrong? But this can't be true! ... Listen, we'll talk later okay?
dlga_start:pin_cpassecovoyidd|So how did it go with the convoy?
dlga_pin_cpassecovoyidd:close_window|I haven't found it yet.
dlga_pin_cpassecovoyidd:pins_maluushhe|I can't handle it sorry.
dlga_pins_maluushhe:close_window|That can't be true... I don't want to overwhelm, but lives depended on the result of this mission. Listen, see you later, okay?
dlga_start:pin_comptsur|How may I help you?
dlga_pin_comptsur:close_parlechefg|Tell me about the resistance.
dlga_pin_comptsur:close_parlechefgsngsl|What do you think of the Freelancer mercenary company?
dlga_pin_comptsur:pin_quoisfairnew|What do we do now?
dlga_close_parlechefg:pin_comptsur|Currently our forces are scattered throughout France. We have only recently begun to gather into groups and organize to fight under the initiative of a mysterious noble, who calls himself the Unicorn. You might have heard of him but nobody really knows his true identity.
dlga_close_parlechefgsngsl:pin_comptsur|They are bastards who work for the highest bidder. Their leader is an unscrupulous noble who is greedy enough to surround himself with the strongest of men and then proceed to shakedown the weakest. Today they are on our side but tomorrow they will be against us. I feel our cause is just. 
dlga_pin_quoisfairnew:pin_quoisfairnewsuit|Now that we are satisfied, we must continue arming ourselves. What we do not have unlike the English and Burgundian soldiers is proper training. I think we can compensate by arming ourself better. Crossbows, culverins, the sharpest and most piercing weapons made out of best steel. 
dlga_pin_quoisfairnewsuit:pin_quoisfairnewsuit2|Sounds like a good start, but where to find such expensive weapons?
dlga_pin_quoisfairnewsuit2:pin_savamennt|The English arms depots that supply fortified towns and their outposts. By taking those shipments not only do they fail to rearm their troops but those weapons end up in our hands. 
dlga_pin_savamennt:pin_quoisfairnewsuit23|It requires careful planning.
dlga_pin_quoisfairnewsuit23:pin_posprincip|A new front is opening not far from here. Our enemy seeks to prevent suspicious rebel movement they have spotted north of our position. What they are likely seeing is rebels converging in their area of operation. If we were to annihilate them, that would discourage their efforts to deploy throughout France. We would force them to fortify their key positions, opening up the countryside for us.
dlga_pin_posprincip:pin_digndun|A plan worthy of grand marshal!
dlga_pin_digndun:pin_jointu|Thank you. The problem is that their hosts are small, but they are well equipped. It would be wasteful to attack them head on. We must be crafty. At this point we should observe our enemies from afar and allow them time to make a mistake without our interference. We make plans for an ambush for which an opportunity will eventually present itself. Then we act. Naturally, you will be joining us?   
dlga_pin_jointu:pin_ouiattaque|I am!
dlga_pin_jointu:close_window|For now, I prefer to remain neutral.
dlga_pin_ouiattaque:close_window|This is perfect! The next weapons convoy shouldn't take too long to appear. You are to intercept it near Rodez. Seek rebel groups and convince them to join you in the assault. If you do not find any in the area, try around Bourges. Good luck, mate.
dlga_start:pin_deautrechhssj|Incredible! You have them, you have the supplies! We get to eat! How can we thank you, comrade?
dlga_pin_deautrechhssj:pin_autechoises|Find some way.
dlga_pin_deautrechhssj:close_window|It was nothing.
dlga_pin_autechoises:pin_autechoises2|Of course, now that you are one of us, I'll let you in on our secrets. We are mainly supported by the common folk. Some pretend to have a sudden admiration for England, but in reality they put aside weapons and other resources for us. For you I have a contact in Bordeaux, the bookseller. If you are in need just say that the archangel Michael is hungry and he'll know what to do.
dlga_pin_autechoises2:close_window|I'll remember that.
dlga_start:pin_alorsfin|Will you bring us food?
dlga_pin_alorsfin:close_window|Working on it.
dlga_start:pin_twochance|So you changed your mind? My men are on the verge of starvation, just go get us some food please.
dlga_pin_twochance:close_twoochanc|It's okay, I'll bring you food.
dlga_pin_twochance:close_window|I can't, I already have enough problems as it is.
dlga_close_twoochanc:close_window|Really? We count on you. I beg you, do not disappoint. They expect a real meal after having to resort eating scraps for weeks.
dlga_start:pin_cheffd|Do not touch your weapons, tell me who you are?
dlga_pin_cheffd:pin_cheffdff|I am {playername}. Michel sent me, we travelled together and he told that there's work to be done. He also told about a potential reward.
dlga_pin_cheffdff:pin_cheffdff2|...about that reward. Well, frankly I don't approve of Michel's methods. Although we certainly sent for help, he shouldn't have lied about the reward.
dlga_pin_cheffdff2:pin_cheffdff3|I see.
dlga_pin_cheffdff3:pin_cheffdff5e|In fact we have nothing and we are in the progress of slowly being eaten away by hunger. Our cause is just, which I hope will affect you enough for you to join us. Believe me, sooner or later we will return to you hundredfold what you could do for us right now.
dlga_pin_cheffdff5e:pin_caider|Well, what can I do to help you?
dlga_pin_cheffdff5e:pin_caider.1|So this is kind of an investment? In that case, what can I do for you?
dlga_pin_cheffdff5e:close_window|This is a waste of my time, adieu.
dlga_pin_caider:pin_nouriss|Well, as you can see, we have no provisions. I have to quickly find something to eat for my men or they'll wither away. Mutiny is not out of the question. I feel that to boost their morale, a barrel of beer, bread, cheese and dried meat is the least I can do.
dlga_pin_nouriss:close_pinchef|It's okay, I'll see what I can do.
dlga_pin_nouriss:close_window|I can't, I already have enough problems as it is.
dlga_close_pinchef:close_window|Really? We count on you. I beg you, do not disappoint. They expect a real meal after having to resort eating scraps for weeks.
dlga_start:neutre_benezzendquete|What are you doing on the ramparts?
dlga_neutre_benezzendquete:close_window|I recall some old memories.
dlga_start:neutre_benezzendquete2|What are you doing?
dlga_neutre_benezzendquete2:close_window|I recall some old memories.
dlga_start:spont_endquete|Then?
dlga_spont_endquete:spont_endquete2|That's it, they are with the Pope. There's no doubt we can leave quietly.
dlga_spont_endquete2:close_window|Good, it's my task to explain this to the master. We'll share a mug at the tavern of Bourges if we ever bump into each other. Goodbye and thank you friend, for all your help.
dlga_start:spont_mauvaisquete|Let's get out of here and pray that we don't get into trouble.
dlga_spont_mauvaisquete:close_window|I don't know if what we have just done is really just, let's go.
dlga_start:apon_en_ataquee|Then?
dlga_apon_en_ataquee:apon_en_ataquee2|I don't know, maybe we should wait a little before we message the surrender.
dlga_apon_en_ataquee2:close_window|I don't like it if... NO! They are attacking us! Weapons!!! Defend your miserable lives.
dlga_start:strapon_en_attente|Well? Go see the inquisitor's face... what do you want to do?
dlga_strapon_en_attente:close_window|I'll go, but I hope he doesn't shoot me.
dlga_start:strapon_quesstbene|What are you doing around here mate? I hope you bring us reinforcements or a message.
dlga_strapon_quesstbene:strapon_quesstbene2|I'm reinforcements, but I'm all alone and I have no message. The master would have given it to me if there was one.
dlga_strapon_quesstbene2:strapon_quesstbene3|What? The master really does questionable acts. He must think we're invincible soldiers, or he simply wants our death.
dlga_strapon_quesstbene3:strapon_quesstbene4|He sent me here as reinforcement without even telling me who is besieging. What is the situation?
dlga_strapon_quesstbene4:strapon_quesstbene5|Ha, Ha, Ha! Forgive me, but it's really laughable, you don't even know? Well open your ears comrade: the Duke of Provence is in a proper tussle with the Pope. Because of a disagreement, Avignon, which is under the protection of the Duke, found itself besieged overnight. We were hired to resist the Papal army. I hope that our action is legitimate, we have expected a messenger to arrive for so long and provide a confirmation but no one comes. So here we are holding the bridge for our company and the Duke of Provence. We were paid for in advance, but all of that was spent a long time ago.
dlga_strapon_quesstbene5:strapon_quesstbene6|Excuse me? What are the consequences and what alternatives are available to us?
dlga_strapon_quesstbene6:strapon_quesstbene7|It's pretty simple, if our action is not legitimate, an emissary courier should arrive and tell us to fall back and let the Pope take Avignon. If our action is lawful and just, we must continue to defend against a possible usurper, securing the city by holding the only access, the bridge.
dlga_strapon_quesstbene7:strapon_quesstbene8|And if the army should attack the Pope? Fight or surrender?
dlga_strapon_quesstbene8:strapon_quesstbene9|You know the situation... I refuse to make that decision, because if we're wrong and the inquisitor is legitimate, we risk excommunication, imprisonment or death at the stake. If we abandon the Duke of Provence we would also face similar trouble. So neither an attack or a surrender seems possible. 
dlga_strapon_quesstbene9:strapon_quesstbene10|I would make it.
dlga_strapon_quesstbene10:close_window|Okay! Start by talking to the inquisitor. It's been days since they spoke to us. Perhaps they are expecting a message too, with the stamp of the Pope affirming their action. But it could also be fake, I wouldn't take that kind of decision based on a message supposedly from our company. Go see the inquisitor in their camp. Don't worry they'll let diplomats through.
dlga_start:spont_mauvaisquete2|Let's get out, the work is out there.
dlga_spont_mauvaisquete2:close_window|I don't know if what we have just done is really just.

dlga_start:sltrapon_ques5|They attack, why wait?
dlga_sltrapon_ques5:close_window|They prefer that we leave. What they need to understand is that mercenaries have taken the city by this point. They may have not understood that the company will not let go of a contract.
dlga_start:spont_mauvaisquete7|It was a dirty battle.
dlga_spont_mauvaisquete7:close_window|Let's go.
dlga_start:sltrapon_ques6|Do something, or it will go wrong.

dlga_inqq_questionor_reditions3:inqq_questionor_reditions4|Where can I see the Papal coat of arms? Why don't you have a banner? And why have you recruited mercenaries as a Papal guards?
dlga_inqq_questionor_reditions4:inqq_questionor_reditions4con|I see, these mercenaries have been employed since the last Pope and our banner is... I'm sorry but it fell out of the supply wagon while crossing a river. You must believe me, don't take the risk of doing harm to the Kingdom of France and the Pope himself.

dlga_benez_winnlbattle2:benez_winnlbattle3|The Pope? No, you got me wrong. The inquisitor acted according to his own interests. The Pope does not recognize it and it was the reason why we were on it, at least for the client we got the contract from. 
dlga_benez_winnlbattle3:benez_winnlbattle4|Nice maneuver on your part. The inquisitor is entirely legitimate and you knew it was going to end badly for us.

Most of us stayed here in wait for the bulk of their company to arrive. Their formation will be shattered at the warehouses that they thought was only guarded by the militia. The Dauphin will be pleased with my service, I'm sure.
dlga_end_quetebourgland3:end_quetebourgland4|So you sent us to feint them terribly outnumbered, at the risk of my life and all those men?

dlga_end_quetebourgland6:end_quetebourgland7|Later my friend, later. There's still fighting going on at the warehouses. Go swiftly and lend a hand to your companions and we will add 200 crowns to your purse.

dlga_end_quetebourgland7:sl_jobhhnew22|I have a doubt... you wouldn't just want me to die in this last fight to save you from having to pay me 500 crowns?
dlga_sl_jobhhnew22:end_quetebourgland7|How can you think of such a thing? This is... sacrilege. Go quickly to the warehouses, please.
dlga_start:here_quetebourgviland|What, are you still here? The robbers can attack at any moment. I suspect they'll be making a diversion for an attack to the warehouses with another group. If we send a small but powerful group out, we can defeat them because they are separated. You must act fast! Reinforce our troops at the hills opposite of Bourges... immediately.

dlga_here_quetebourgviland:here_quetebourgviland2|Sorry, I do not have the skills.

dlga_slslslanottravgg:slslslanottravgg2|Do you have work for me?
dlga_slslslanottravgg2:slslslanottravgg3|You're in luck, the robbers have virtually declared war on Bourges, attracted by the resources of the city. Their leader is Rodrigue Villandrandro. He gathered mercenaries currently out of contract with him and formed a troop of bandits. They have engaged in looting, murders and raping. The worst is that they know how to fight.
dlga_slslslanottravgg3:star_vil_troopp|What should I do?
dlga_star_vil_troopp:star_vil_troopp2|They want our merchandise. We were able to thwart their last push, but it claimed the lives of ten of my men. They have the numbers and according to my informants some of them are already camping around the city. Gather a group of volunteers and intercept them before they come into Bourges, a surprise attack might make all the difference.
dlga_star_vil_troopp2:star_vil_troopp33|Can I have some of your men to assist me?
dlga_star_vil_troopp2:close_window|I'm sorry, but I can't, for now.
dlga_star_vil_troopp33:star_vil_troopp34|Well it's quite risky if I separate the few troops I have left to defend the warehouses. I may favor a possible strategy to create a diversion. If they manage to attack the warehouses with a bigger concentration of force, they might prevail and cause significant damage to the economy of the city. That said, I can give you some men if you agree to this contract. Look for one of our patrols and ask them to follow you.
dlga_star_vil_troopp34:star_vil_troopp35|How's the pay?
dlga_star_vil_troopp35:star_vil_troopp36|No less than 400 crowns.
dlga_star_vil_troopp36:star_vil_troopp37|600 and they won't bother you any more.
dlga_star_vil_troopp37:star_vil_troopp38ok|Should I remind you that you are in my service? You disappoint me... 500 crowns, payable on your return if you win.

dlga_start:slsfastjoblossekotavlys|So what? What has happened to you?
dlga_slsfastjoblossekotavlys:slsfastjoblossekotavlys2|He had to, I wasn't able.
dlga_slsfastjoblossekotavlys2:close_window|NO!... He had to be stopped by the guard. The Dauphin will hold me accountable, get out of my sight, miserable peasant!
dlga_start:slsfastjobtav|Hurry, damn it! He'll kill everyone in the tavern of Three lilies.
dlga_slsfastjobtav:close_window|I'm running.
dlga_start:slslslnotjoba4|You're still here, what do you want?
dlga_slslslnotjoba4:slslslnotjoba41|Do you have work for me?
dlga_slslslnotjoba41:slslslnotjoba41suit|There is something you could do, it's a mission we can't... a delicate matter, it's a very annoying problem with respect to our main employer Dauphin Charles VII.
dlga_slslslnotjoba41suit:slslslnotjoba41suit2|Keep going.
dlga_slslslnotjoba41suit2:slslslnotjoba41suit3|One of our men did the unthinkable. He killed a town militia in a fit of drunken rage. Now he's at the tavern of the Three lilies in the poor neighborhood of Bourges. If this were to reach the Dauphin's ears that would be the end of our contracts. The faster you get rid of him the better. Do it as discretely as possible, I do not care how.
dlga_slslslnotjoba41suit3:slslslnotjoba41okjob|It's a dirty job, but we don't always have a choice. 
dlga_slslslnotjoba41suit3:close_window|I refuse to kill one of our own, farewell.
dlga_slslslnotjoba41okjob:close_window|Perfect, I knew I could count on you, my nimble friend.
dlga_start:slslslnotjob|You're still here, what do you want?
dlga_slslslnotjob:trlastjob_gorddad|Do you have work for me?
dlga_slslslnotjob:close_window|I'm going.
dlga_trlastjob_gorddad:close_window|No, there's nothing for you, maybe later.
dlga_start:patpatroll_sucessuc|You are back already, how was the patrol?
dlga_patpatroll_sucessuc:patpatroll_sucessuc2|It's done, master. The streets were fairly quiet, but at the warehouses I got jumped by two bandits. I had to kill both of them.
dlga_patpatroll_sucessuc2:close_window|Perfect! All in a day's work. These warehouses are a problem, we haven't seen the last of it. But it won't keep me awake at night, at least for the time being.
dlga_start:patpatroll_endbourgend|You are back already, how was the patrol?
dlga_patpatroll_endbourgend:patpatroll_endbourgend2|Well... I came across two bandits, armed to the teeth. They took me by surprise and knocked me out, fortunately I was able to escape with my life...
dlga_patpatroll_endbourgend2:close_window|What?! Oh, that's just perfect. Now everyone will think that the Freelancer is a group of pansies, and it's not worth it to hire them. Just let the looting continue as these so called protectors are incapable of getting things in control. The bandits have moved their loot to their hiding place by now. Disappear! I am disappointed that I was so misguided about your abilities.
dlga_start:ptrolssldejass|You are back already, how was the patrol?
dlga_ptrolssldejass:ptrolssldejassz22|I'll get on it, master.
dlga_ptrolssldejass:ptrolsslstop22|Master, I'm sorry, but I can't take care of it.
dlga_ptrolsslstop22:close_window|Really? You refuse a mission? Get out of my sight! I wonder about the efficiency of our admissions test.
dlga_ptrolssldejassz22:close_window|Don't forget to talk to those responsible for their neighborhood! It's they who decide if they still want to keep paying us. To do so they must see that their money is being spent well. You don't have to know all these details, just do your job.
dlga_start:gordnoentrygord|Here you are.
dlga_gordnoentrygord:gordnopremiertf|I passed your tests successfully. Do you have a job for me?
dlga_gordnoentrygord:close_window|I'll be back, I just wanted to pay my respects.
dlga_gordnopremiertf:gordnopatries|I saw it, not too bad work I guess. Anyway, we have many mercenary contracts to complete. Here's a brigandine with our coat of arms. Take good care of it. Wear it proudly and defend our colors against our enemies, whatever they may be. You now belong to the Freelancers! 
dlga_gordnopatries:gordnopatrienoata|Am I to fight against anyone?
dlga_gordnopatrienoata:gordnopatrirefle|Rest assured, we are allies of the Dauphin Charles V of France and we are on his payroll. It could last. But when we have to change sides or fill out a delicate contract, you will have to do so without qualms. The company motto is that we will fulfill the contract even if it takes us to hell. Are you willing to go that far? Of course in return you will be very well paid, but this depends on the nature of the contract of course.  
dlga_gordnopatrirefle:gordnopatenfinsl|Long live the Freelancers! I am yours, master.
dlga_gordnopatrirefle:gordnopatenfinsl.1|I'm afraid I don' have a choice, I need money.
dlga_gordnopatrirefle:close_window|I have to think, I'll be back.
dlga_gordnopatenfinsl:gordnopatenfinslstar|Understood. You are in and I have a task for you. Bourges militia has seen their numbers and quality decline recently because of the war and the resurgence of bandits. Their number is deemed insufficient by the noble bourgeois, so they paid us to strengthen the ranks of their men. Your mission is to patrol the streets of Bourges. Display your shining arms while walking through the streets as a show of force, so they can in good conscience continue to pay heavy taxes for their safety.
dlga_gordnopatenfinslstar:gordnopatenfinslstar2|Understood.
dlga_gordnopatenfinslstar2:gordnopatenfinslstar3|We also need to scare the robbers away, but beware, if you fall prey to one of their ambushes we will be ridiculed. The Dauphin would have to think twice before offering us another contract. So we are counting on you, do you understand?
dlga_gordnopatenfinslstar3:gordnopatenfinslstar4|Yes. Do not worry, I will arm myself heavily and I will stay on my toes.
dlga_gordnopatenfinslstar3:close_window|I'm sorry, but I can not do this job for the moment.
dlga_gordnopatenfinslstar4:travailsl_pat|Well, here are the details of the mission. You are to patrol the city and talk to the vendors and officials in each area. Ask them if everything is ok.
dlga_travailsl_pat:travailsl_pat2|I got it.
dlga_travailsl_pat2:close_window|It goes without saying that you shouldn't allow yourself to get beaten by the robbers, or the company's name will be tarnished. You will receive your pay when the task is completed successfully. Now off you go to do the soldier's work!
dlga_start:gordnoentrygorddd|What impudence! Leave immediately, don't you know who I am? Go back to take the admission tests. After those we'll talk, before that you are not allowed to enter.
dlga_gordnoentrygorddd:gordnoentrygordai|I'll leave if that will calm you down.
dlga_gordnoentrygorddd:close_window|My apologies, I did not know where I was going.
dlga_gordnoentrygordai:close_window|It sickens me having to hire soldiers with so little education. I'm unfortunate to have you in my company, now disappear!
dlga_start:champgomastermaitrav|Still alive? You're not so bad then.
dlga_champgomastermaitrav:champgomastermaitrav2|What do you think of the master?
dlga_champgomastermaitrav:close_window|I'll take this opportunity, farewell.
dlga_champgomastermaitrav2:close_window|Who? Oh yes, the master. I do not want to return.
dlga_start:champgordtav|The battlefields of the north are truly horrible. The cold, the blood on the snow. Wolves everywhere that come to eat the carcasses of the victims of the fighting. Sometimes I wonder why I committed to this lot.
dlga_champgordtav:champgordtavc2|What else is there to do? Become a potter and live off the land?
dlga_champgordtav:close_window|It is never too late to get the hell out.
dlga_champgordtavc2:champgordtavc2cc3|I know it would be nice to be rich, to have land...
dlga_champgordtavc2cc3:champgordtavc2cc322|It is certainly not so simple as it sounds.
dlga_champgordtavc2cc322:close_window|Perhaps, but if we don't have a purpose then life is really for naught. It's better to die pursuing your dreams than to live a sheltered life.
dlga_start:gordtavpaysan|It's a private operation. We won't let just any peasant with a pitchfork come here in search of gold.
dlga_gordtavpaysan:gordtavpaysan2|Fighting here would be a very bad idea.
dlga_gordtavpaysan2:close_window|You got the all-inclusive, so off you go.
dlga_start:gordnofacboirt1|Let me drink alone.
dlga_gordnofacboirt1:gordnofacboirt12|What do you think of the master?
dlga_gordnofacboirt1:close_window|Bottoms up, you drunk. Farewell.
dlga_gordnofacboirt12:gordnofacboirt13|I don't think so. I'm doing my job and I get paid. You will learn soon enough to do the same and you will see that this is the good life.
dlga_gordnofacboirt13:gordnofacboirt14|I think you're right
dlga_gordnofacboirt14:close_window|I'm always right. You'll never be rich, but still richer than many French.
dlga_start:gordnofac1bcdd|I'm well on my way to forgetting my last mission ever happened.
dlga_gordnofac1bcdd:gordnofac1bcddwat|What happened?
dlga_gordnofac1bcdd:close_window|In that case, I'll leave you.
dlga_gordnofac1bcddwat:gordnofac1bcddwat2|A beautiful mess! Sometimes I think that the Dauphin Charles hired us just to keep the dirt and corruption from touching his good lords. Anyway, I was on the job with some city grunts to escort a convoy. These guys seemed like proper soldiers so I didn't worry too much. But at the first blush of combat the bastards fled. We got ambushed by some roadside bandits armed with just pitchforks. Seeing I was hopelessly outnumbered I had to do the same. I escaped and left the cargo behind.
dlga_gordnofac1bcddwat2:gordnofac1bcddwat212|You did the right thing, why risk your life if you had no chance?
dlga_gordnofac1bcddwat212:close_window|I think you don't understand, the master would've wanted me to give my life rather than flee. It's bad for the reputation of the company, a soldier of the Freelancers fleeing mere peasants. The master doesn't know it yet and I'm in no hurry to report back to him, for sure.
dlga_start:gordnofac1bc|Hey! This is the tavern of the company. You're not one of ours, so go somewhere else!
dlga_gordnofac1bc:close_window|No need to take that tone.
dlga_start:vvgordtavern1|So you're one of us, eh? It's nice to see that our numbers are increasing. The more people we have in the Freelancers the better my back will be covered! This one is on me.
dlga_vvgordtavern1:generique_des|Cheers! How about we play a few crowns in a game of chance?
dlga_vvgordtavern1:close_window|Thank you, but I do not have time.
dlga_generique_des:start_pf|Play heads or tails.

dlga_des_mises2:des_mises3|I won! Ha ha ha.
dlga_des_mises2:close_window|I lost.
dlga_des_mises3:close_window|You can't win every time.

dlga_goodintelend55:close_window|Go to see the master of the company at the top of the tower overlooking the square. He will give you armor and your first assignment. Forgive me if I don't celebrate your victory with you, but I have better things to do. Like teach those two scrubs how to fight.  
dlga_start:gordgord_failidiot|Oh, but this must be our would-be genius! You returned to take the test that you felt you were too stupid to complete the first time around?
dlga_gordgord_failidiot:close_window|Do not go too far...
dlga_start:dumydial_testgord2fall|It wasn't that hard, am I right? You showed that you know how to use a blade. You have the skill to face our enemies and sufficient force to break them.
dlga_dumydial_testgord2fall:gordencgage|I commit.
dlga_gordencgage:gordainintelstart|Not yet, the last test is a quiz. When you are given a contract to complete for a client, strength, speed and knowledge, as well as an ability to adapt to new situations are required. You tell me, are you smart enough to become a Freelancer?
dlga_gordainintelstart:gordencgage2|We will find out soon enough.
dlga_gordencgage2:gordainintelgot|Listen carefully, probey. The man who makes it doesn't want it. The man who wants it doesn't use it. The man who's using it doesn't know he is using it?

dlga_goodintelend:goodintelend2|It's... the right answer, is it not?
dlga_goodintelend2:goodintelend3|Yes.
dlga_goodintelend3:goodintelend5|So I passed?
dlga_goodintelend5:close_window|Go to see the master of the company at the top of the tower overlooking the square. He will give you an armor and your first assignment. Forgive me if I don't celebrate your victory with you, but I have better things to do. Like teach those two scrubs how to fight.

dlga_march_dijs1:march_dijsgro|Why not buy from wholesale?
dlga_march_dijs1:march_ressodij|I'd like to learn how to forge weapons.
dlga_march_dijs1:close_window|You're welcome.
dlga_march_dijsgro:march_dijs1|Of course you can compare prices and buy the cheapest resources, but we strive to offer the lowest prices. Moreover the variety of materials we gather to ensure the continual operation of all of our craftsmen is impressive. It's almost priceless for them not having to move from town to town in a time of war.    
dlga_march_ressodij:march_ressodij2|If you're interested in manufacturing weapons, you start with a blueprint that you can buy from a blacksmith. That'll include a list of required resources and tools. Then you just forge them. Some advanced weapons require higher level of agility.

dlga_enquete_rouen_tav6:enquete_rouen_tav7|You know it won't happen. Waste of time, my employer will deny everything and you have no proof. You'll just lose your inn... so talk now.

dlga_chplacef_wwiin:chplacef_wwiinnou|She is ours!
dlga_chplacef_wwiinnou:chplacef_wwiinnoulic|I knew you would succeed, I'm not doubted for a moment. When I met Licorne, he told me about interesting projects. I told him about you, and if you wish, you could work directly for him and help him to realize his plans, what do you say?
dlga_chplacef_wwiinnoulic:chplacef_wwiinnoulicok|All right, I agree.
dlga_chplacef_wwiinnoulic:close_window|Not for the moment, I have too much to do.
dlga_chplacef_wwiinnoulicok:close_window|Perfect, he will come to you in the garden of Poitiers. As soon as he knows that you have entered the city, he will give you the instructions when you see him. We will continue to fight against the Burgundians, as always. Thanks for everything, friend, and always keep hoping that he will come.
dlga_start:chplacef_faill|Hello friend, I have returned. So this stronghold?
dlga_chplacef_faill:chplacef_faill2|We have not arrived.
dlga_chplacef_faill2:chplacef_failllico|It's not possible, I told you to prepare your plan before. Well, we can not do anything now. I met Licorne, and he told me about interesting projects. I told him about you, and if you wish, could you work directly for him and help him realize his plans, what do you say?
dlga_chplacef_failllico:chplacef_failllicook|All right, I agree.

dlga_start:chief_verznewattentt|{playername}? When will you go to the stronghold? We are all counting on you.
dlga_chief_verznewattentt:close_window|I must prepare, I will go there as soon as possible.
dlga_start:domi_deuxchancepforte|So? Are you ready to take my men to the stronghold ?
dlga_domi_deuxchancepforte:domi_deuxchancepforteok|Yes I am ready.
dlga_domi_deuxchancepforte:close_window|I have to prepare as much as possible.
dlga_domi_deuxchancepforteok:close_window|This is what I like to hear, and remember, take the time to observe from a distance and plan the attack, friends. As for me, a long journey awaits.
dlga_start:chief_verznewquessst|{playername}, I'm glad you are here. For the help you provided, I decided to reward you as best as I can. As you know we have nothing, but there are contacts that supply us when we really need it. Gp see the gravedigger in the graveyard of Calais, and tell him this: the angels of Dominique require a sword. He will give you what he has gathered for us, I'm sure you'll use it well.
dlga_chief_verznewquessst:domi_newqquest|What can we do to press the Burgundians of New Dominique?
dlga_chief_verznewquessst:domi_fosst|Who is this gravedigger?
dlga_chief_verznewquessst:close_window|Thank you, everything helps. I must go now, but I will come back as soon as possible.
dlga_verz_diomipredial:chief_verznewquessst|Anything else you'd like to ask me?
dlga_domi_fosst:verz_diomipredial|He used to be one of ours, but he was injured and had to leave us. However, he has continued fighting the good fight, by helping us hide our weapons or anything else in fake graves in the cemetery of Calais.
dlga_domi_newqquest:domi_newqquest2|We can do better than that, and we will take their stronghold.
dlga_domi_newqquest2:domi_newqquest3|Take a stronghold with seven men? You must be joking.
dlga_domi_newqquest3:domi_newqquest4|No, just you six, I will not come, as I am meeting Licorne. But I assure you, there is only a handful defending the place. I entrust you with the command, {playername}. I have been observing you and I know that you will be up for this task. Do not let the men charge blindly, I also recommend that you take a higher ground to coordinate the attack.
dlga_domi_newqquest4:domi_newqquest5|I believe in you, friends. By St. Michael, you will take this place and Licorne will decide what to do next.
dlga_domi_newqquest5:domi_newqquestokk|Very well, I would take this place alone, if it is necessary.
dlga_domi_newqquest5:domi_newqquestwait|I'm not yet ready, could you wait a while?
dlga_domi_newqquestwait:close_window|Very well, but do not drag on too much. I can postpone my departure, but not forever.
dlga_domi_newqquestokk:close_window|This is what I like to hear, and remember, take the time to observe at a distance and plan the attack. Farewell, friends, a long journey awaits.
dlga_start:winverzetpy|Ah, here you are. It was a beautiful fight in Metz, is it not? These dogs got what they deserved, and we finally have our bellys filled. Here is your reward, I hope that you will apreciate the loot taken from the Bourgignons. It was really good work friend, thank you.
dlga_winverzetpy:close_window|It was a pleasure, really.
dlga_start:faillverzetpy|Well, we can say that we failed. At least we could have stale bread and stinking water in the dungeon, except that I even hungrier than before leaving for this cursed warehouse.
dlga_faillverzetpy:faillverzetpy2|What more can we do? At least we will have tried.
dlga_faillverzetpy2:close_window|Bah! I do not want to talk.
dlga_start:metz_averzy_verzz|Go ahead and wait for us at the river.
dlga_metz_averzy_verzz:close_window|Good.
dlga_metz_averzy_verzz:metz_averzy_verzzfail|I do not think I can do it.
dlga_metz_averzy_verzzfail:close_window|But that's not true ... oh well, go where you want, traitor.
dlga_start:chief_verzz|Greetings my friend, I am Dominique, if you are in the heart of the forest, you must have read my message hidden in the grave and you have been able to decipher it ...a moment please, if you are not one of us, then you must find this conversation rather... strange.
dlga_chief_verzz:chief_verzz2|Do not worry I'm a rebel, the chief of Montpellier sent me, and I found your message.
dlga_chief_verzz2:chief_verzzchoi|Well, we are starting on a good foundation then. You did well to come to us, we have difficulties  carrying out our operations. The towns of Burgundy are too well guarded, and our goal is to harass the Burgundian enemy in his own territory, even during the truces.
dlga_chief_verzzchoi:chief_starbourds|What can we do to fight the Burgundians?
dlga_chief_verzzchoi:chief_verzzrien|Do you not feel like fighting for nothing sometimes?
dlga_chief_verzzchoi:chief_verzztoul|Why did you leave the camp at the city of Toul?
dlga_chief_verzzchoi:close_window|I have to leave, but we will resume this conversation later.
dlga_chiefvz_prediaien:chief_verzzchoi|Do you have any other questions?
dlga_chief_verzztoul:chiefvz_prediaien|I do not want to hear about that horrible place. It is impossible think about it without being distressed, and it has become unbearable. We really had to leave and we are much better here for the moment.
dlga_chief_verzzrien:chiefv_liccoorrnnn|And what do you propose? To enlist in the guard of Charles VII? It's not better believe me. We must fight again, until we are numerous enough and we will follow the instructions of Licorne.
dlga_chiefv_liccoorrnnn:chiefv_liccoorrnnn22|Who?
dlga_chiefv_liccoorrnnn22:chiefvz_prediaien|Then you have not heard of Licorne? He is the leader of all the rebels, at least he will become one. I already met him and he told me to come here. He is a great strategist, the war will be won as soon as we meet under his banner.
dlga_chief_starbourds:chief_starbourdsokmiss|We have no food, so to start, we should attack a caravan. However, there is something  simpler and less dangerous. The warehouses of Metz, receives the food for the duke's soldiers from Germany daily. It is not very well guarded and we just have to get rid of the few guards to be able to take all the food we need. The problem occurs if we get noticed and patrols search the forests, however we will see how it goes once we have a full stomach. Will you accompany us?
dlga_chief_starbourdsokmiss:chief_starbourdsokmissoui|All right, I follow you, I'm starving.
dlga_chief_starbourdsokmiss:close_window|Not for the moment, I'll come back later.
dlga_chief_starbourdsokmissoui:close_window|Very well ... ah, by the way, if we were separated in the battle, we will of course meet here at this place of the forest. Well, I think everything is ready we can leave, we will meet again in Metz, pass by the river below and wait for us at the bottom of the door of the Germans.
dlga_start:verz_mztzprebat3|Let's go to camp.
dlga_verz_mztzprebat3:close_window|Do not take long.
dlga_start:verz_mztzprebat4|We do not want to fail, let's take the time to plan.
dlga_verz_mztzprebat4:close_window|It will be alright...

dlga_verz_mztzprebat5:close_window|Do not take long.

dlga_verz_mztzprebat6:close_window|It will be alright...

dlga_verz_mztzprebat7:close_window|Do not take long.

dlga_verz_mztzprebat9:close_window|Do not take long.
dlga_start:verz_mztzprebat10|We do not want to fail, let's take the time to plan.
dlga_verz_mztzprebat10:close_window|It will be alright...
dlga_start:vict_etpmetz|We had them! Take everything you can and go. We'll meet back at camp.
dlga_vict_etpmetz:close_window|Do not take long.
dlga_start:comando_rappelmo|Go kill the guard at the entrance of the bridge, drop a tile on his head. We will send the signal as soon as he is dead and we attack.
dlga_comando_rappelmo:close_window|I'll go.
dlga_start:comando_etp1|We are here, it seems to be well presented. Here take that crossbow and those tiles, do you see the stone gateway down there before the bridge? The guard is alone, moreover when you kill him you will have a very good position to cover us, but pay attention to their arrows. As soon as the guard is dead, we send the signal and attack. Go! Now.
dlga_comando_etp1:comando_etp2|Do not take long, I'll be alone in the gate for a while.
dlga_comando_etp2:close_window|So, jump from the roof of the tower to the river and they will be stuck in the gate and we will pick them covered by their archers in the gate itself.

dlga_start:metz_gardechiour|Get out, do not go near the warehouse.
dlga_metz_gardechiour:close_window|I have no desire to stay here with you, no worries.
dlga_start:fossde_calaigiv|Hello, what can I do for you?
dlga_fossde_calaigiv:fossde_calaigivgo|I am looking for the rebel materials, if you please.
dlga_fossde_calaigiv:close_window|Nothing, I was just walking around.
dlga_fossde_calaigivgo:fossde_calaigivgo2|Sorry? You must be mistaken.
dlga_fossde_calaigivgo2:fossde_calaigivgo3|Oh, that's right ... Dominique's angels want a sword.
dlga_fossde_calaigivgo3:fossde_calaigivgo4|It's good, friend. Give me time to unearth the chest, here ... there is the enough to forge weapons, if you do not know how to do it right, you have only to resell the everything, I hope it will help you anyway. Good luck.
dlga_fossde_calaigivgo4:close_window|Thank you for the goods, looking forward to seeing you again ... in another place.
dlga_start:fossde_calai3|Good morning visitor, do you come to gather on a grave?
dlga_fossde_calai3:fossde_calai34|Not really, I got lost.
dlga_fossde_calai34:close_window|You'd better get back to town before dark, the wolves roam around here, and in the evening fall, the place and pretty spooky.
dlga_start:trop_montalravitail|Do you know if the beer has arrived Sir? He had to bring it up with the rest of the supplies.
dlga_trop_montalravitail:close_window|I do not know anything about it, but refueling in the mountains in times of war must not be so simple. 
dlga_start:trop_montalpesmon|What a beautiful place, and so well protected tactically, I feel safe here.
dlga_trop_montalpesmon:close_window|A haven of peace at the top of the mountains, far from the war, only dream of better by the times.
dlga_start:trop_montalpeschop|What a beautiful landscape, is not it?
dlga_trop_montalpeschop:close_window|Really dazzling indeed.
dlga_start:trop_montalpeschopici|Good morning, what are you doing here?

dlga_trop_montalpeschopici2:close_window|Really? I'll buy you a pint after my guard in this case.

dlga_trop_montalpes:trop_montalpes2|This place reminds me of old memories.
dlga_trop_montalpes2:close_window|Ah yes? Well, you can stay without restrictions in this case.
dlga_start:fortep_chef|Greetings, I am responsible for the defense of this place, what can I do for you, friend?.
dlga_fortep_chef:fortep_chefrebp|In what way does this stronghold serve the rebellion?
dlga_fortep_chef:close_window|Nothing, I'm just passing through.
dlga_fortep_chefrebp:fortep_chefrebp2|We contribute to the French domination by causing damage to the Burgundians, moreover if the troops of Charles VII wanted to attack Dijon to force the Duke of Burgundy to stop serving the interests of the King of England, this is where they would prepare the attack. An advanced post in enemy territory could not be more secure and comfortable.
dlga_fortep_chefrebp2:fortep_chefrebptaf|Is there work for me here?
dlga_fortep_chefrebp2:close_window|Thank you for the information, goodbye.

dlga_rerencontliccoo:rerencontliccoorel|I'm sorry, but I lost the letter of recommendation, do you have another?
dlga_rerencontliccoo:close_window|I had just remembered all these moments.
dlga_rerencontliccoorel:rerencontliccoorel22|Well, it's not uncommon to lose such a thing, I hope that being a Knight is important enough for you to take care of it.
dlga_rerencontliccoorel22:rerencontliccoorelem|My apologies.
dlga_rerencontliccoorelem:close_window|Look, here it is. It lacks the illuminations that my scribe had made for you, the king will not have the opportunity to admire them, but in time of war it would be enough to have a name engraved on a stone to recruit new Knights.
dlga_start:erereticqu|What are you doing here heretic? How could you refuse to confess?
dlga_erereticqu:close_window|I have other beliefs about men and religion, goodbye.
dlga_start:enfinpurifier_oklettre|{playername}, are you purified from your sins?
dlga_enfinpurifier_oklettre:enfinpurifier_oklettre2|I am Messire, will you give me this letter for the King?
dlga_enfinpurifier_oklettre2:close_window|Of course, here it is. I would be happy to count among ourselves a noble man of heart and strong spirit. However, even with this letter, you will still have to win the favors of the king. Becoming a Knight without a noble name is more difficult than you think.
dlga_start:attesteretlaverpechh|{playername}, are you purified from your sins?
dlga_attesteretlaverpechh:close_window|I'll take care of it Messire.
dlga_attesteretlaverpechh:attesteretlaverpechheret|I do not want to confess, I will obtain this letter in other ways.

dlga_start:ddernieraveclicornn|{playername}, how good it is to see you again. You have become a hero, did you know that?
dlga_ddernieraveclicornn:ddernieraveclicornne|What do you mean ?
dlga_ddernieraveclicornne:ddernieraveclicornne2|Do you not know? The common people call you the Black Death. Don't be alarmed, people do not think you are a plague, but they mean that those who meet you, end up dead. In any case, the general and the enemy governors have tripled their guards and it is a good thing that they are afraid.
dlga_ddernieraveclicornne2:ddernieraveclicornnez3|I have a favor to ask of you, Sir.
dlga_ddernieraveclicornne2:close_window|I must leave you Messire. I'll speak with you at another time.
dlga_ddernieraveclicornnez3:ddernieraveclicornnez3ok|I'm listening...
dlga_ddernieraveclicornnez3ok:ddernieraveclicornnez4|I truly desire to become a Knight, and I need a letter of recommendation for that to give to the king. You are noble, are you not? Can you recommend me?
dlga_ddernieraveclicornnez3ok:close_window|No, it's nothing ...
dlga_ddernieraveclicornnez4:ddernieraveclicornnez5|Well, I would normally refuse an assassin to become a Knight, but ... it's because of me that you had to indulge in these ... murders, moreover it was for the good of France. So, I accept, with eyes closed. 
dlga_ddernieraveclicornnez5:ddernieraveclicornnez6|Believe me, Messire, it is men who make good knights, not laws.
dlga_ddernieraveclicornnez6:ddernieraveclicornnez8|Certainly ... but first of all you must confess, then you will have my letter, and once a Knight by the grace of Saint Michael, you must, in spite of everything keep to the laws.
dlga_ddernieraveclicornnez8:ddernieraveclicornnez9|Where can I confess?
dlga_ddernieraveclicornnez9:close_window|At the cloister of the Jacobins in Toulouse. They are the ones who prepare our knights for their purification in order to swear an oath. You have the makings of a great Knight, {playername}.
dlga_start:retourtuerbanquierreiim|{playername}, you're alive! How did it go?
dlga_retourtuerbanquierreiim:retourtuerbanquierokok|The merchant fell, a victim of poison.

dlga_start:retourtuerbanqperduf|{playername}, you're alive! How did it go?
dlga_retourtuerbanqperduf:retourtuerbanqperduf2|I could not poison him, I apologize.
dlga_retourtuerbanqperduf2:close_window|Well, I guess you did your best ...
dlga_start:avisavecaffairelicornn|{playername}, I hope you have not changed your mind about our business.
dlga_avisavecaffairelicornn:close_window|I'll take care of it Messire.

dlga_derniere_meurtelico:derniere_meurtelicotbar|Another brazen assassination?
dlga_derniere_meurtelicotbar:derniere_meurtelicotbardoit|I fear it. He is a Burgundian whom we all want to see disappear, he is a rich merchant and an incredibly rich businessman. It finances part of the equipment of the Burgundian troops, if the brave French are torn off the battlefield by a ballista, he is responsible.
dlga_derniere_meurtelicotbardoit:derniere_meurtelicomany|Where, when, and for how much?
dlga_derniere_meurtelicotbardoit:close_window|I have no hesitation in killing people, do you believe that?
dlga_derniere_meurtelicomany:derniere_meurtelicomasom|Go find him in his mansion in Metz, he has started festivities for a week. If he died, his fortune will go to his young son, who committed not to use it for the arming of the Duke of Burgundy... It is unfortunate to come to such situations, but it is really the son who has sought to meet a group of rebels to assassinate his father.
dlga_derniere_meurtelicomasom:derniere_meurtesorr|You forget the reward.
dlga_derniere_meurtesorr:derne_meurtesostart|Indeed, my apologies, I guess another 1000 crowns should be enough, will you handle it? And of course, do not mention my name or our meeting places if you were caught, not even under torture.
dlga_derne_meurtesostart:derne_meurtesostart2|Done, for 1000 crowns, I rise to the challenge.

dlga_win_killgouv_chass3:win_killgouv_chass4|These missions are difficult to say the least, men have lost their lives to help me, they are heroes, make sure that their families are helped in return.
dlga_win_killgouv_chass4:win_killgouv_chass5|It is unfortunate, but there were no other solutions, I would ensure that their families receive land and considerable benefits. Believe me, they did not die for nothing, when become a living legend.

dlga_ico_assassinchassegouv2:ico_assassinchassegouv3|He often goes hunting in the area of Senlis, you will find him sooner or later in his camp, but be careful, he is always surrounded by his guards.

dlga_lico_terpoitier:lico_evail.1|Your cause brings me nothing, will you pay me for this job?
dlga_lico_terpoitier:lico_who|Who are you, Sir?
dlga_lico_terpoitier:lico_bye|My apologies, but I am exhausted by all these trips, can we resume this conversation later?
dlga_lico_enedial:lico_terpoitier|Do you have any questions?
dlga_lico_who:lico_enedial|I can not reveal to you my identity, call me the Licorne, like all the leaders I receive.
dlga_lico_bye:close_window|Naturally, I apologize for my lack of hospitality, but you will sleep in the tavern. I can not have a known rebel in my apartments, it would destroy my cover. I wish you a good evening, all the same.
dlga_lico_evail:lico_rtquestone|Naturally I will pay you in gold crowns for each contract you perform, provided that you fulfill the objectives defined by the mission.
dlga_lico_rtquestone:lico_enassassina|It suits me, what is the mission?
dlga_lico_rtquestone:close_window|I need to think about it, I'll come back later.
dlga_lico_enassassina:lico_enassassina2|The small groups of rebels I want to gather are busy attacking convoys, robbing Burgundian peasants, and stealing food baskets. All this will not take us anywhere. I have to defeat the invader more harshly, more radically, yet this work is unworthy of a gentleman and contrary to the spirit of chivalry to which I adhere.
dlga_lico_enassassina2:lico_enassassina3|I fear the worst.
dlga_lico_enassassina3:lico_enassassina4|I need an assassin, someone to approach the enemy close enough to be able to deal a fatal blow, someone cunning and has experience with weapons. But at the same time, someone who does not aspire to become a Knight, in return you will lead the good life with what I pay you, what do you say ?.
dlga_lico_enassassina4:lico_orgold|I want to be a Knight, but I would live with it if it is for the good of France.
dlga_lico_enassassina4:lico_orgold.1|Only gold interests me ... a lot of gold, I agree.
dlga_lico_enassassina4:close_window|I must refuse Sir, I also aspire to the spirit of courtesy and respect towards my enemies.
dlga_lico_orgold:lico_assaenego|Well, the first target is the Comte de Caen. He is a very active and repressive general towards our French subjects in the occupied cities, we must get rid of him as soon as possible, the king himself desires his death ardently and secretly.
dlga_lico_assaenego:lico_assaenegod|He is having a banquet at the ducal castle of Caen. Here is a forged invitation to give to the guards, with the seal of the Count himself made by our scribes. Go to the castle, mingle with the guests, and find a way to get rid of this character.
dlga_lico_assaenegod:close_window|Once the Count is dead, jump down onto the street, and join the rebel who will have you out of the city through shortcuts before the guard is alerted, then leave the city. Good luck my friend, we are counting on you.

dlga_start:vilain_start|I raise my glass to our honourable guest, what news of the front, sire?
dlga_vilain_start:vilain_start2|Sorry?
dlga_vilain_start2:vilain_start3|I don't give a damn about you. Isn't that how they talk up there? The English aristocrats? Give me your stuff.
dlga_vilain_start3:vilain_start4|Doesn't it trouble you, robbing others?
dlga_vilain_start3:close_window|That's what I thought.
dlga_vilain_start4:close_window|Did you hear that? This moron wants to teach me morals. Listen carefully. What I do not have and that others have, I will take tomorrow, is our motto down here.
dlga_start:catrib_stat|What are you looking at?
dlga_catrib_stat:catrib_statno|I was wondering if you ... well ....
dlga_catrib_stat:catrib_statpriso|What is a girl like you doing in this place? Do you want me to get you out of here?
dlga_catrib_stat:close_window|Nothing at all.
dlga_catrib_statno:catrib_stat|Only with Messire Villandrandro, do you understand? So be on your way.
dlga_catrib_statpriso:close_window|Are you joking? Up there is war and famine, here I live like a queen. I am richer than the wife of the Duke of Burgundy. In exchange for all that, I do not give a fuck to see the sun.
dlga_start:catta_guardd|Be careful, watch your movements, that we do not take them for an attack on Messire Villandrandro.
dlga_catta_guardd:close_window|You should drink and relax, no one wants to kill your boss.
dlga_start:catta_guardd22|What do you want?
dlga_catta_guardd22:close_window|I'm just admiring your face.
dlga_start:guid_tivilandrro|What's up, did you see a ghost?
dlga_guid_tivilandrro:guid_tivilandrroexitwork|Open up, it seems that the boss has work for me.
dlga_guid_tivilandrro:guid_tivilandrroexit|Get me out of here.
dlga_guid_tivilandrro:close_window|Very funny, really ...
dlga_guid_tivilandrroexitwork:close_window|It's okay, you can go. Prepare to meet Messire Villandrandro.
dlga_guid_tivilandrroexit:close_window|But of course, my duchess. Bertrand will immediately climb all the stairs to open the door. This is the last time you make me climb up.
dlga_start:passvin_to_catacomb|What is a soldier? I do not offer my charms if that is what you wanted.
dlga_passvin_to_catacomb:passvin_to_catacomb2|Take me to the catacombs instead.
dlga_passvin_to_catacomb:close_window|You are really too ugly. I would rather a woman who smells like the pigsty.
dlga_passvin_to_catacomb2:close_window|Are you tired of the sun? Very well, follow me and you know the rule, put this bag on your head.
dlga_start:vilain_to_catacomb|Soldier, approach a little here ...
dlga_vilain_to_catacomb:vilain_to_catacomb2|If you want gold, I do not have any.
dlga_vilain_to_catacomb:close_window|No, it is too much trouble.
dlga_vilain_to_catacomb2:vilain_to_catacomb3|No, you're wrong, I do not want to take your gold, but give you gold.
dlga_vilain_to_catacomb3:vilain_to_catacomb4|A charity?
dlga_vilain_to_catacomb4:vilain_to_catacomb5|That's exactly it ... in a way. My friends and I are looking for someone who have nimble hands and who runs fast in case of problems.
dlga_vilain_to_catacomb5:vilain_to_catacomb6|I need money, tell me more about it.
dlga_vilain_to_catacomb6:vilain_to_catacomb7|Like everyone else, we'll tell you more if you follow. I feel better in our place, I do not like hanging out in the street.
dlga_vilain_to_catacomb7:vilain_to_catacombok|If only to speak, we will see later.
dlga_vilain_to_catacomb7:close_window|If you think I'm going to follow you to your ambush, go away.
dlga_vilain_to_catacombok:close_window|Finally, It took some time to find someone... take this torch, you will need it where we are going, and because we do not know you yet, you will make the trip with this bag on your head. You will have to come back later with the guard. Once there, you'll have to go down until you meet the leader. Let's go...
dlga_start:fend_dialrodrigg|What do you want ?
dlga_fend_dialrodrigg:faux_docsstart|Can you make forged documents?
dlga_fend_dialrodrigg:fend_dialrodriggenco|I need gold again.
dlga_fend_dialrodrigg:close_window|Nothing, I have better things to do than breathe the mold.
dlga_fend_dialrodriggenco:close_window|No, there is nothing for you, your face is known, I need new blood.
dlga_faux_docsstart:faux_docsstart2|Of course, but you would have to pay the price, what do you think?
dlga_faux_docsstart2:faux_docsstart2ok|I aspire to become a Knight, but I need a letter of recommendation, and ...
dlga_faux_docsstart2ok:faux_docsstart2conc|Duke of Provence, how's it going? It will cost you 4000 crowns, but with your future situation you will earn much more. Deal?
dlga_faux_docsstart2conc:faux_docsstart2concpay|It's understood.
dlga_faux_docsstart2conc:close_window|I should be able to get it honestly, nevermind.
dlga_faux_docsstart2concpay:close_window|Voila, you think you're not the only one to make such requests, my chest is full. All these letters are signed and bear the seal of the Duke, it was not easy, but I knew I would get what I deserved.
dlga_start:attent_winoffarmer|So? Have you avenged us?
dlga_attent_winoffarmer:attent_winoffarmer2|Yes, it was not easy but he and his wife died, here is his medal.
dlga_attent_winoffarmer2:close_window|It's perfect, the matter is settled, here's your gold, I'll fall asleep more easily now ..
dlga_start:attent_defaitefarmer|So? Have you avenged us?
dlga_attent_defaitefarmer:attent_defaitefarmer2|It turns out that he was armed with a crossbow and had bodyguards, I could not ...
dlga_attent_defaitefarmer2:close_window|What? It's a simple wounded peasant? You're really a shit, out of here.
dlga_start:attent_killmat|So? You have work, right?
dlga_attent_killmat:close_window|I know, I'll take care of it
dlga_attent_killmat:attent_killmat2|I do not want to kill a man who did not do anything to me, I will not do it.
dlga_attent_killmat2:close_window|Are you stupid? Get out of here then.
dlga_start:attent_killmats|So? You have work, right?
dlga_attent_killmats:close_window|I know, I'll take care of it
dlga_attent_killmats:attent_killmat2d|I do not want to kill a man who did not do anything to me, I will not do it.

dlga_assacata_roddig:assacata_roddigwtoui|What is it?
dlga_assacata_roddig:close_window|No, I do not like it, goodbye.
dlga_assacata_roddigwtoui:assacata_roddigwtouiou|Someone sold me out, someone who works for me as you do now. I want the head of this traitor. I will pay 600 crowns, are you in?
dlga_assacata_roddigwtouiou:assacata_roddigwtouiouok|For 600 crowns? I agree.
dlga_assacata_roddigwtouiou:close_window|No...
dlga_assacata_roddigwtouiouok:assacata_roddigwtoudepart|This son of a bitch has a new life with the gold that my head brought him, he has a farm and a family, he settled near the village of Rennes, his nickname is Mathieu le Fileux, find him there and kill him. Bring me the medal around his neck for proof and you'll get paid.
dlga_assacata_roddigwtoudepart:close_window|Okay.
dlga_assacata_roddigwtoudepart:close_window.1|I can not do that, he has a family.
dlga_start:attent_marchandextorfon|Do you have the gold of the merchants? I am getting impatient.
dlga_attent_marchandextorfon:attent_marchandextorfonok|Here's the gold. You have to trust me.
dlga_attent_marchandextorfonok:close_window|It's a word I do not know, everything is there, now go away.
dlga_attent_marchandextorfon:attent_marchandextorfonjugr|I have lost it, but I will replace it, I swear it.
dlga_attent_marchandextorfonjugr:close_window|That is not good at all. You have three days to find 900 crowns, do you hear? Without that I'll loose my dogs after you, Go now ...
dlga_start:attent_marchandextor|Do you have the gold of the merchants? I am getting impatient.
dlga_attent_marchandextor:close_window|That's exactly why I'm in Paris, I wanted to let you know.
dlga_attent_marchandextor:attent_marchandextorno|I do not want to become an outcast, I refuse.
dlga_attent_marchandextorno:close_window|Try not to disobey me, I can send my dogs to hunt you if you do not collaborate, remember it.
dlga_start:exto_paris|Look who is here, it's our apprentice thief. You come at the right time. I just remembered that nobody cares to collect the fees from the merchants of Paris, could you take care of it? You will receive a percentage in return, what do you say?
dlga_exto_paris:exto_pariswt|What fees?
dlga_exto_paris:close_window|No, not now.
dlga_exto_pariswt:exto_pariswt2|What the merchants owe us in exchange for our protection, you just have to go see them and tell them they have not paid them.
dlga_exto_pariswt2:exto_pariswtstar|If I can get something back, it seems easy.
dlga_exto_pariswt2:close_window|No, I would not do that, goodbye.
dlga_exto_pariswtstar:close_window|It could not be more simple, go see the blacksmith, the gunsmith and the wholesaler, tell them to pay and make them afraid if they refuse. Being brutal and boorish, I think you can do that.
dlga_start:bijchev_star|Do you have the jewelry?
dlga_bijchev_star:bijchev_starrem|Here it is, it cost me much more than if I had honestly done it.
dlga_bijchev_starrem:bijchev_starremnext|Yes! That is it, beautiful. Here are your 1000 crowns, Villandrandro always keep his word. Come back to me if you need gold, I'll definitely have something for you.
dlga_bijchev_starremnext:close_window|We'll see.
dlga_start:bijou_attente|I hope you do not show up in front of me without the jewelry.
dlga_bijou_attente:close_window|I'm on the case.
dlga_bijou_attente:bijou_attno|I can not become the enemy of France, I refuse.
dlga_bijou_attno:close_window|It is quite another to become my enemy, you will learn it at your expense. Now go, you shameful bastard.
dlga_start:cata_aveccle|So, what about this key?
dlga_cata_aveccle:cata_aveccle2|Here you go.
dlga_cata_aveccle2:cata_aveccle2camb|Perfect, keep it, it was a test. I wanted to see if you had guts. This key, my boy, opens a chest in a castle of Tours, jewels and other valuable items are stored there. Bring me a gold ring set with a blue stone, if you come back with, I'll buy it for 1000 crowns. What do you say?
dlga_cata_aveccle2camb:cata_aveccle2camb2|I say it's worth more than that.
dlga_cata_aveccle2camb2:cata_aveccle2camb23|Of course, but what would you do with it? It is a very famous jewelery in France, I can only sell it to my contacts. You have no one to sell it to and you will end your days in jail. If you agree, keep the key to the safe and go to the old castle district in Tours, find a way to enter the vault and bring me the ring.
dlga_cata_aveccle2camb23:cata_aveccle2camstart|It's okay, I will not get caught. Nobody will know that I did it.

dlga_start:rodro_stratdialo|What do we have here? Approach, you seem to be suitable for the job. You're not sick at least, and do you think you're good enough?
dlga_rodro_stratdialo:rodro_stratdialo2|It depends, I need gold but I do not want to kill anyone.
dlga_rodro_stratdialo:close_window|I do not have business with thieves, goodbye.
dlga_rodro_stratdialo2:rodro_stratdialochoi|You will not need to kill if you are agile and clever enough. I need someone who knows how to pick a pocket correctly and without being caught. I need a key, this key is in the coat of a nobleman, who is in the brothel of fancy neighborhoods. Make your way there and take it from him, then bring it back to me, you'll be paid as soon as I get it.
dlga_rodro_stratdialochoi:rodro_stratdialookstrat|Sounds doable, it'll be done, if I have gold in return.

dlga_rodro_stratdialookstrat:close_window|Very well, make your way to the House of the Two Sirens tonight. Approach the Chamberlain and take his key. He always puts it in his right pocket... no need to tell you not to get drunk and finish your night in a bed without taking care of that key. And one last thing, above all, avoid getting caught.

dlga_start:chavieu_troop5|Alert! An intruder!.
dlga_chavieu_troop5:close_window|Stand back!
dlga_start:chavieu_troop3|Alert! Intruders in the castle!
dlga_chavieu_troop3:close_window|No!
dlga_start:chavieu_troop2|Alert! Intruders in the castle!
dlga_chavieu_troop2:close_window|Can't be...
dlga_start:chavieu_troop1|Alert! Intruders in the castle!
dlga_chavieu_troop1:close_window|Damn.
dlga_start:farm_feeear2|Go away!
dlga_farm_feeear2:close_window|You won't see me again.
dlga_start:femme_farm_farmer|What... what do you want, who are you?
dlga_femme_farm_farmer:close_window|Don't be afraid, I just want to talk to your husband.
dlga_femme_farm_farmer:close_window.1|Don't worry about it, woman.
dlga_start:farm_endo|You should go now.
dlga_farm_endo:close_window|I'm leaving.
dlga_start:farm_feeear|Who are you? What do you want?
dlga_farm_feeear:farm_feeearoui|Are you Matieu le Fileux?
dlga_farm_feeearoui:farm_feeeardac|... I have not been called like that for a long time, I imagine that pig Villandrandro paid you to find me.
dlga_farm_feeeardac:close_window|That's right, he wants your head, nothing personal...
dlga_farm_feeeardac:farm_feeeardacafe|Maybe we can work it out, he just wants the medal you have around your neck, give it to me and it'll all be over.
dlga_farm_feeeardacafe:close_window|Well, it has great value for me, but I guess I have no choice, here, and thanks stranger, whoever you are.
dlga_start:passe_resecata|Go on...
dlga_passe_resecata:close_window|Good morning to you too...
dlga_start:passent_citcata|Not one more step! What are you doing here?
dlga_passent_citcata:passent_citcata2|Are you a thief? I am armed, you should think twice before attacking me...
dlga_passent_citcata2:passent_citcata3|Thieves? No, we're rebels, honest citizens, what's left of them. And who are you?
dlga_passent_citcata3:passent_citcatavoirch|I'm on your side, do you have a leader?
dlga_passent_citcata3:close_window|All right, I'm going, I just wanted to take a look at the place.
dlga_passent_citcatavoirch:close_window|Well... okay, the chief's downstairs, near the fire, watch out, we're watching you.
dlga_start:etrange_tete|Well, it's strange to see new faces, especially in a place like this.
dlga_etrange_tete:close_window|It is also strange to see so many people living underground.
dlga_start:citycata_start|Tell me friend, what's the situation upstairs?
dlga_citycata_start:citycata_startmauv|Paris is still under the English, the situation is delicate.
dlga_citycata_start:citycata_startesp|Paris is under the English at the moment, but it will soon change believe me.
dlga_citycata_start:citycata_startlibr|Paris is liberated! You should get out of here...
dlga_citycata_start:close_window|I have no time for complacency, farewell.
dlga_citycata_startmauv:close_window|Oh...I see. Let us pray that it will change, what else can we do?
dlga_citycata_startesp:close_window|I am hoping wholeheartedly, I'm ready to fight to free the city if I have to.
dlga_citycata_startlibr:close_window|What ?! That is great! I... it would be funny to leave here like this, I'll wait a bit...
dlga_start:vendeur_catares|Welcome, whoever you are... I have things to sell if you are interested.
dlga_vendeur_catares:vendeur_cataresvend|What do you have for sale?
dlga_vendeur_catares:close_window|No, thank you.
dlga_vendeur_cataresvend:vendeur_cataresvend2|Weapons, and a few trinkets.
dlga_vendeur_cataresvend2:vendeur_cataresvend3|I assume you won't accept crowns?
dlga_vendeur_cataresvend3:vendeur_cataresvend4|Well, I prefer to trade with something that I can eat, but crowns could serve me later. Here, take a look.
dlga_vendeur_cataresvend4:vendeur_catares|Anything else?
dlga_start:fem_rebelcatas|I don't want to stay here anymore, I want to fight, tell them you come from above.
dlga_fem_rebelcatas:fem_rebelcataswrong|It's a bad idea, you're not trained and you have no protection, you're going to have a certain death.
dlga_fem_rebelcatas:fem_rebelcatasright|There is a chance if we are united.
dlga_fem_rebelcatas:close_window|It's none of my business, sorry.
dlga_fem_rebelcataswrong:close_window|You are no better than the others, out of my sight ...
dlga_fem_rebelcatasright:close_window|I knew it, you hear? Are you ready to fight?!
dlga_start:fem_rebfear|I prefer to stay here alive, rather than try to fight and lose my life, or worse to end up tortured in the dungeons of Paris.
dlga_fem_rebfear:fem_rebfearwhy|Why not go back and live a quiet life in Paris?
dlga_fem_rebfear:close_window|It's none of my business, sorry.
dlga_fem_rebfearwhy:close_window|Impossible, most of us would refuse to serve our enemies. What's more, we are outlaws! We would end up on the scaffold as soon as we see the light of day.
dlga_start:assieg_enddialereb|We'll meet outside.
dlga_assieg_enddialereb:close_window|Very well.
dlga_start:assieg_depuislcatas|And good friend... are we going to besiege Paris?
dlga_assieg_depuislcatas:assieg_depuislcatas2|Yes, now, join us at the siege camp outside.
dlga_assieg_depuislcatas:close_window|It's not necessary, not now...
dlga_assieg_depuislcatas2:assieg_depuislcatasor|Finally! We will talk once outside, someone trustworthy like you would need to lead the rebels.
dlga_assieg_depuislcatasor:close_window|To arms, all of you! Pick up anything that could be used as weapons and go out, we'll fight for Paris!
dlga_start:crypte_clearrr|We have succeeded, we have a little time before they send their next patrol. Again thanks friend, as promised come see us when the French will besiege Paris, we'll join you then.
dlga_crypte_clearrr:close_window|This time will come sooner or later, take care of yourself.
dlga_start:crypte_attaq|Go through the door, we follow you to the Crypt... good luck.
dlga_crypte_attaq:close_window|Shoot as fast as you can, I'll finish them off.
dlga_start:parler_rebelquattt|Approach, friend. Now that the others are no longer hungry, we can talk seriously.
dlga_parler_rebelquattt:parler_rebelquattt2|What do you want to talk about?
dlga_parler_rebelquattt:close_window|I don't want to be mixed up in your stories...
dlga_parler_rebelquattt2:parler_rebelquatttsuit|I want to talk to you about our condition. The English know that we are somewhere in the catacombs and they regularly send patrols, looking for us. They have never found this place, but a few days ago, our scouts have seen them coming dangerously close and they are currently camping in a crypt not far from here.
dlga_parler_rebelquatttsuit:parler_rebelquatttsuit2|Impossible to even blink under these conditions, let alone sleep. So it is preferrable that it is we who attack them during their sleep. You seem to know how to fight and we are only poor archers, could you join us for the attack?
dlga_parler_rebelquatttsuit2:parler_rebelquatttsuitpari|What would I gain in return?
dlga_parler_rebelquatttsuit2:close_window|It's far too dangerous, you can't even see a meter. I cannot help you.
dlga_parler_rebelquatttsuitpari:parler_rebelquatttsuitpari3|Paris !
dlga_parler_rebelquatttsuitpari3:parler_rebelquatttsuitpari4|Excuse me?
dlga_parler_rebelquatttsuitpari4:parler_rebelquatttsuitpariok|Gather the men outside or tell the Dauphin that he can count on us if he besieges the city. We are not the best archers but we are very numerous in these galleries. If you manage skillfully, you can start the siege and you may be chosen to become the governor of the city and enjoy the wealth it could bring to you. What do you say?
dlga_parler_rebelquatttsuitpariok:parler_rebelquatttsuitpariyes|I will have to put all this in place, but certainly... let's get rid of the patrol first.
dlga_parler_rebelquatttsuitpariok:close_window|These are the demented words of a desperate man. I would not go to the dungeon with you, farewell.
dlga_parler_rebelquatttsuitpariyes:close_window|Ok! Everybody's ready. Check your equipment and go through the door behind me, we go straight to the crypt where the English sleep...
dlga_start:faim_dernier|Do you have anything to eat, friend?
dlga_faim_dernier:take_cheescatares|Yes, here's some cheese and bread.
dlga_take_cheescatares:close_window|How can I thank you? It is good to see that not everyone has lost their pity in these troubled times.
dlga_start:faim_retourrd|Food I beg you, these people will starve.
dlga_faim_retourrd:close_window|I'll see what I can do.
dlga_start:fem_rebfearss|Come, don't be afraid. We are rebels, if you are on our side you have nothing to fear, if you were a spy on the other hand, your fear would be justified...
dlga_fem_rebfearss:hung_fearcatastat|I'm against the English in any case, what are you all doing here underground?
dlga_fem_rebfearss:close_window|I prefer to leave...
dlga_hung_fearcatastat:hung_fearcatastat2|We are outlaws, we refuse to serve the English, and their friends, those Burgundian traitors. We stay here and we prepare what we can to take over the city as soon as the opportunity arises.
dlga_hung_fearcatastat2:hung_fearcatastat3|How do you survive?
dlga_hung_fearcatastat3:hung_fearcatastatfaib|We eat insects and rats in the best of cases. We go out to steal, only when we have found nothing, but it is very risky and most volunteers never come back... we do not know each other but, could you bring us some dinner? I beg you, there are women and weak people here.
dlga_hung_fearcatastatfaib:hung_fearcatastatfaibok|It's okay, I'll see what I can find in Paris.
dlga_hung_fearcatastatfaib:close_window|I can't, I'm sorry. Good luck...
dlga_hung_fearcatastatfaibok:close_window|Oh, really? I do not know what to say...and well, I think bread and cheese should suffice, if you come back, you will have really done a good deed believe me.
dlga_start:sang_teror|Blood... everywhere...
dlga_sang_teror:close_window|And you say you want to deliver the Battle of Paris.
dlga_start:sang_teror2|They're dead.
dlga_sang_teror2:close_window|In any case they already have their crypt.
dlga_start:sang_teror3|We got 'em.
dlga_sang_teror3:close_window|We're not hunting.
dlga_start:sang_teror4|All that blood...
dlga_sang_teror4:close_window|And you say you want to deliver the Battle of Paris.
dlga_start:sang_teror5|They got what they deserved.
dlga_sang_teror5:close_window|The place of a woman is surely not in a crypt nor to engage in war.
dlga_start:fierbois_talkpretr|Have you come to gather in our chapel, my brother?
dlga_fierbois_talkpretr:fierbois_talkpret2r|I'm looking for a sword.
dlga_fierbois_talkpretr:close_window|That's right.
dlga_fierbois_talkpret2r:close_window|My brother, it is not here that you would find one, so let's go to town we are not blacksmiths.
dlga_start:fierbois_trouveeeat|But where do you get this sword, my brother?
dlga_fierbois_trouveeeat:close_window|You have a good chapel. It's probably been here since time immemorial.
dlga_start:fierbois_talkautrpret|What can I do for you, my brother?
dlga_fierbois_talkautrpret:fierbois_talkautrpret2|I'm looking for a sword, would you have seen one around here?
dlga_fierbois_talkautrpret:close_window|Nothing, thank you.
dlga_fierbois_talkautrpret2:close_window|Are you drunk? I suggest you leave.
dlga_start:fierbois_trouveee|Well, is that a sword?
dlga_fierbois_trouveee:fierbois_trouveee2|Didn't I tell you? Jeanne la Lorraine asked me to pick her up, without even being sure of her existence, it seems to be a relic and she says she needs it to liberate France.
dlga_fierbois_trouveee2:close_window|God Almighty! Then we'll pray for her.
dlga_start:fierbois_passageretoure|Well, I don't see a sword, have you finished searching?
dlga_fierbois_passageretoure:fierbois_passageretoureend|I want to go back to the chapel, I may not have looked at it with enough attention.
dlga_fierbois_passageretoure:close_window|Yes, right now, but I'll be back.
dlga_fierbois_passageretoureend:close_window|I suspected it, and well, come in.
dlga_start:fierbois_passagepretr|Peace be with you brother, what are you doing amongst us?
dlga_fierbois_passagepretr:fierbois_passagepretr2|I'm looking for a sword, have you seen one in the vicinity?
dlga_fierbois_passagepretr:close_window|I was going to go, thank you.
dlga_fierbois_passagepretr2:fierbois_passagepretr3|A sword you say? No, we're not armed see, why are you asking me that?
dlga_fierbois_passagepretr3:fierbois_passagepretr4|Can I look inside the chapel? It's very important.
dlga_fierbois_passagepretr4:fierbois_passagepretr5|It's enough, my brother, I refuse, leave now.
dlga_fierbois_passagepretr5:fierbois_passagepretr6|This is an order of the Dauphin Charles himself. There may be a relic in these walls, and I must take her back to Jeanne la Lorraine. If I find a sword in this chapel, it will be the proof of my statements, otherwise I would go away, do not fear.
dlga_fierbois_passagepretr6:close_window|Gather weapons to give them to a woman? If what you say is true, then France is lost. Enter if this is the only way for you to stop tormenting us.
dlga_start:gardeseigneutri|No sudden gestures, nor speak louder than his lordship.
dlga_gardeseigneutri:close_window|Let his lordship be sure, I have no desire to speak nor to strike.
dlga_start:marrr_winess|I do not know how you thank, you have the makings of a great knight.
dlga_marrr_winess:close_window|It was my duty.
dlga_marrr_winess:close_window.1|These words don't cost you anything.
dlga_start:marrr_looses|Out of my sight, you let my daughter die in this forest.
dlga_marrr_looses:close_window|I understand.
dlga_start:roue_winiifille|So? Did you find my daughter?
dlga_roue_winiifille:roue_winiifille2|I found her, and she is alive. It was some of your mercenaries that kidnapped her. They believed that their pay was too low and they committed this heinous act as a revolt against you.
dlga_roue_winiifille2:roue_winiifille2pay|What are you saying? Bastards... the culprits will be punished with death. I will gather an army of those that remained faithful and we will punish them. I will find sleep only after having wrenched their heads with my own hands.
dlga_roue_winiifille2pay:roue_winiifille2pay2|When you, well, you suspect I can't pay you. It's horible, I'm ruined and it cost my daughter's virtue, and it could have cost her life
dlga_roue_winiifille2pay2:roue_winiifille2paychoi|I apologise, but I lied to you. I don't own 10,000 crowns, will you forgive me or kill me?
dlga_roue_winiifille2paychoi:roue_winiifille2paychoiend|You had no choice, I understand.
dlga_roue_winiifille2paychoi:roue_winiifille2paychoiendpay|I risk my life for gold, find compensation immediately or I'll take everything you have.
dlga_roue_winiifille2paychoiend:close_window|You are worthy of the greatest knights, God bless you, sir.
dlga_roue_winiifille2paychoiendpay:close_window|Look, I can only give you 200 crowns, that's the all I have left, I'm sorry.
dlga_start:roue_failfille|So? Did you find my daughter?
dlga_roue_failfille:roue_failfille2|Unfortunately, I was wounded trying to save her.
dlga_roue_failfille2:roue_failfillewho|What? Bastard ... what do you know, what did they do to her and who were they?
dlga_roue_failfillewho:roue_failfillewho2|It was the mercenaries you were paying that violated her.
dlga_roue_failfillewho:close_window|Unfortunately, I did not have time to see them, they hurt me with a arrow.
dlga_roue_failfillewho2:close_window|What are you saying? Bastards... the culprits will be punished with death. I will gather an army of those that remained faithful and we will punish them. I will find sleep only after having wrenched their heads with my own hands.
dlga_start:roue_attente_nouv|So? Did you find my daughter?
dlga_roue_attente_nouv:close_window|Not yet, but I'm on the trail.
dlga_roue_attente_nouv:close_window.1|I refuse to take care of this, find another stooge.
dlga_start:march_rouenapp|You! Approach... come closer.
dlga_march_rouenapp:march_rouenapp2|What's the matter?
dlga_march_rouenapp:close_window|It is not my habit to stop on command, my lord.
dlga_march_rouenapp2:march_rouenapp3|Are you looking for work? You look like a mercenary.
dlga_march_rouenapp3:march_rouenappsold|Depends on the pay.
dlga_march_rouenapp3:close_window|I'm not a mercenary, you're mistaken.
dlga_march_rouenappsold:march_rouenappsoldchoi|Brigands have taken my beloved daughter, only God knows where they took her. I would pay you 10,000 crowns if you bring her back to me, what do you say?
dlga_march_rouenappsoldchoi:march_rouenappsoldchoiok|For such a sum, I would find her!
dlga_march_rouenappsoldchoi:close_window|There is a catch, it seems like a certain death to me. I refuse..
dlga_march_rouenappsoldchoiok:march_rouenrancon|Well, start by questioning the Tavern Keeper in our city of Rouen, he served foreigners that day. They concealed their faces under a hood, but he did not want to tell me about this subject, he probably heard information but he had to be threatened. Threaten him when you can, he may give you more clues, and come back with my poor daughter, only God knows what they did to her.
dlga_march_rouenrancon:march_rouenrancon2|Did they ask for ransom?
dlga_march_rouenrancon2:close_window|Well no, that's what worries me, hasten on your quest I beg you.
dlga_start:sauveroloups_go|Could we go? The wolves are getting closer.
dlga_sauveroloups_go:close_window|Don't worry about it.
dlga_start:sauverouenfor_end|You killed them all! Thank you, sire, you are my savior, my champion, Grace be with you.
dlga_sauverouenfor_end:sauverouenfor_end2|Let's not forget the 10,000 crowns.
dlga_sauverouenfor_end:close_window|It was my duty, Madam, let's go back to Rouen.
dlga_sauverouenfor_end2:sauverouenfor_end3|Did my father really promise you 10,000 crowns? But...he is ruined, it is impossible for him to pay you any crowns. Please, do not be too hard on him when you see him again, he lied to you to save me.
dlga_sauverouenfor_end3:close_window|Can we leave now?
dlga_start:sauvetage_roeunfor|Who... who are you?
dlga_sauvetage_roeunfor:sauvetage_roeunfor2|I'm here to save you gentle lady, stay away during the fight.
dlga_sauvetage_roeunfor:close_window|Don't pay any attention to me.
dlga_sauvetage_roeunfor2:close_window|Lord, I am finally rescued. Be careful, these are the mercenaries my father hired and they know how to fight.
dlga_start:sauvetage_attachh|Hey! Who are you?
dlga_sauvetage_attachh:sauvetage_attachh2|Release the girl or you will die.
dlga_sauvetage_attachh:close_window|Don't pay any attention to me, I just wanted to pick up some wood.
dlga_sauvetage_attachh2:sauvetage_attachh3|Ha, ha, ha how touching, the knight comes to save his beautiful lady, but you are alone and we are three strong fellows.
dlga_sauvetage_attachh3:sauvetage_attachh4|You will soon be only two, then you may be the last to die.
dlga_sauvetage_attachh4:close_window|Show me if you fight as well as you speak, on guard.
dlga_start:sauvetage_attautre|What are you doing here, Knave? We're busy, don't you see?
dlga_sauvetage_attautre:sauvetage_attautre2|What are you doing here with this lady?
dlga_sauvetage_attautre:close_window|Don't pay any attention to me, I just wanted to pick up some wood.
dlga_sauvetage_attautre2:sauvetage_attautre3|If you don't leave right now, we're going to cut your throat and throw you in the river.
dlga_sauvetage_attautre3:sauvetage_attautre4|Release the girl immediately.
dlga_sauvetage_attautre4:close_window|Show me if you fight as well as you speak, on guard.
dlga_start:sauvetage_dernier|Hey, what are you doing here?
dlga_sauvetage_dernier:sauvetage_dernier2|Do you have a lady with you?
dlga_sauvetage_dernier:close_window|Don't pay any attention to me, I just wanted to pick up some wood.
dlga_sauvetage_dernier2:sauvetage_dernier3|Ha, ha, no she is not for sale, she is ours, her father had hired us as mercenaries, but this pig son no longer pays, so we are paid with a good time with his daughter, and like that, justice is done.
dlga_sauvetage_dernier3:sauvetage_dernier43|I understand, I would even have a payment of 10,000 crowns for your heads.
dlga_sauvetage_dernier43:close_window|What? You're going to die dirty pig.
dlga_start:damme_finalmontppel|Thank you for what you've done, don't worry about me, I'm fine, really.
dlga_damme_finalmontppel:close_window|Well, I have to leave you, ma'am.
dlga_start:damme_aaretrouvmariss|Hey, you are here! Have You found my husband?
dlga_damme_aaretrouvmariss:damme_retrouvmarissvrai|Yes, but I'm afraid that he admitted to his betrayal, he asks you to forget.
dlga_damme_aaretrouvmariss:damme_retrouvmarissfaux|I found him, and he asked me to tell you that it will take time to prove his innocence.
dlga_damme_retrouvmarissvrai:close_window|It is not possible, are you sure? I ... I'll have to put this behind me then. Thank you for your honesty and for looking into it, messire.
dlga_damme_retrouvmarissfaux:close_window|What good news, I thank you, messire. I would have waited for a lifetime for my husband. Thank you, traveller.
dlga_start:damme_monptchearchmar|Have you started looking for my husband?
dlga_damme_monptchearchmar:close_window|I'm working on it, Madame.
dlga_start:damme_monpt|Excuse me sir, you look like an adventurer. Are you travelling?
dlga_damme_monpt:damme_monpt2|I just arrived. Why?
dlga_damme_monpt:close_window|I am not interested.
dlga_damme_monpt2:damme_monpt3|Well, trips these days are quite dangerous, due to the war, and the roads are infested by robbers. However,  I must have news of my husband. You see, he is wrongfully accused of betrayal by the Dauphin Charles, but I am sure that there he is innocent. If you happen to meet my husband during your travels, tell him that his wife believes in his innocence, and that she will wait for him until this evil is righted.
dlga_damme_monpt3:damme_monpt4|What do I stand to gain in all of this?
dlga_damme_monpt4:damme_monptchoi|You will find that ... I don't have the resources. For a small amount, say 200 crowns, please send him a message. I do not know where in Paris exactly, but you can tell him that Madeleine sent you.
dlga_damme_monptchoi:damme_monptchoicom|Agreed. If I am in Paris, I will deliver your message.
dlga_damme_monptchoi:close_window|I cannot do everything, farewell Madame.
dlga_damme_monptchoi:damme_monptrec|How will I recognize him?
dlga_damme_monptrec:damme_monptchoi|My husband has brown hair, young, has a mustache, and responds to the name, Bernard.
dlga_damme_monptchoicom:close_window|I am grateful to you, messire. You are a brave man.
dlga_start:compcata_attentefin|What are we waiting for?
dlga_compcata_attentefin:close_window|We start from this step...
dlga_start:compcata_activqst|What do you want? Leave me alone, please.
dlga_compcata_activqst:compcata_activqst2|Are you Bernard?
dlga_compcata_activqst:close_window|Ok...
dlga_compcata_activqst2:compcata_activqst3|Who's asking?
dlga_compcata_activqst3:compcata_activqst4|Your wife, Madeleine sent me, she says that she thinks you are innocent from your judgment of treason, and she awaits your return. She said that you would give me 200 crowns for the message, and I am in a hurry.
dlga_compcata_activqst4:compcata_activqst5|Poor Madeleine, you know, I'm really a traitor, I don't deserve it. Just tell her to start over.. when I'm gone.
dlga_compcata_activqst5:compcata_activqst6|And my 200 crowns?
dlga_compcata_activqst6:compcata_activqst7|I don't have anything, as you can see. But I am truly grateful for your message.
dlga_compcata_activqst7:compcata_activqst8|I see, what are you going to do?
dlga_compcata_activqst8:compcata_activqst9|Probably take my life, I do not deserve to live after betraying my homeland and my wife.
dlga_compcata_activqst9:compcata_activqst10|Join my band, you have your vengeance against the English and perhaps redeem yourself who knows. Moreover, a warrior dies in battle, and don't forget that you still owe me 200 crowns.
dlga_compcata_activqst10:close_window|I accept, I hope of regaining back my place at the side of my bride.
dlga_start:compcata_star|What do you want? I want to be alone, so please leave.
dlga_compcata_star:compcata_star2|Are you a warrior?
dlga_compcata_star:close_window|Okay...
dlga_compcata_star2:compcata_star3|I am a knight.
dlga_compcata_star3:compcata_star4|You don't look much like a knight.
dlga_compcata_star4:close_window|All right, thank you for giving your opinion, goodbye.
dlga_start:comporle_attendre|Well, what are we waiting for? My crossbow's going to rust.
dlga_comporle_attendre:close_window|Let's go.
dlga_start:comporle_star|I'm in a bad mood, so avoid offending me, whoever you are.
dlga_comporle_star:comporle_star2|Having some trouble, Messire?
dlga_comporle_star:close_window|I would rather not speak to you in this case, whoever you are.
dlga_comporle_star2:comporle_star3|I had to go to the Marshmanship tournaments in Paris, but on the pretext that we are at war, the Lord of Paris refuses to welcome soldiers who served against him. It is not against the rules of the Archery Range, why make a mockery of noble traditions? Especially since it is not with such acts that the contenders to the throne of France will make themselves more legitimate.
dlga_comporle_star3:comporle_starok|You look like an excellent marskman, would you like to join? I pay very well for my mercenaries.
dlga_comporle_star3:close_window|I wish you good luck, messire.
dlga_comporle_starok:comporle_starchoi|All right, I would ask you for 120 crowns, and I will follow you in your campaigns.
dlga_comporle_starchoi:close_window|All right, here they are, try not to get yourself killed.
dlga_comporle_starchoi:close_window.1|I cannot pay such a sum for a single mercenary.
dlga_start:compmarsa_attendre|Can we get started, comrade?
dlga_compmarsa_attendre:close_window|Forward...
dlga_start:campmarsss_star|Greetings, are you a messenger or do you have a message to send?
dlga_campmarsss_star:campmarsss_star2|I am a messenger, and many other things depend on the opportunities.
dlga_campmarsss_star:close_window|None of that.
dlga_campmarsss_star2:campmarsss_star3|You are right, by the times that run you must know how to be flexible to earn a living, I am myself mercenary, soldier, Baker, Sinner, and Messenger.
dlga_campmarsss_star3:campmarsss_rass|Maybe you'd like to join an army? I want to gather men for various reasons.
dlga_campmarsss_star3:close_window|It's inevitable indeed, I have to go now, have a good trip.
dlga_campmarsss_rass:campmarsss_rass2|It's quite tempting, I would follow you for only 60 crowns, and the right to plunder the bodies of our enemies, what do you say?
dlga_campmarsss_rass2:close_window|A competent soldier? At that price? All right, come on.
dlga_campmarsss_rass2:close_window.1|I cannot pay such a sum for a single mercenary.
dlga_start:depart_debourgslmess|Well, what do you expect?
dlga_depart_debourgslmess:close_window|Let's go.
dlga_start:comp_bourgslqst|Hello, it seems to me that you aren't one of the locals. Please, who are you?
dlga_comp_bourgslqst:comp_bourgslqst2|I'm {playername} and some business brought me to Bourges.
dlga_comp_bourgslqst:close_window|One who can be of interest to you.
dlga_comp_bourgslqst2:comp_bourgslqst3|Well, please forgive me this indiscretion, but I am on guard. In front of the Messengers Guild, which is one of the most boring jobs, believe me.
dlga_comp_bourgslqst3:comp_bourgslqst4|If your job bothers you, why don't you come with me? I'm gathering men to form a small party. My intentions are good and I think there's money to be made also for you.
dlga_comp_bourgslqst3:close_window|Good luck.
dlga_comp_bourgslqst4:comp_bourgslqstok|Enough, I'm in! Provided that you pay me a signing bonus, say 100 crowns.
dlga_comp_bourgslqstok:close_window|I'm delighted to have a former member of the Freelancers in my company.
dlga_comp_bourgslqstok:close_window.1|I can't pay that kind of money, maybe later.
dlga_start:close_window.6|{s20}
dlga_start:camp_monk_discuss|{playername}, do you need something or will you keep staring at me?
dlga_camp_monk_discuss:camp_monk_heal_head|I took a hit to the head, help me please.
dlga_camp_monk_discuss:camp_monk_heal_arm|I took a cut to the arm, it's starting to smell...
dlga_camp_monk_discuss:camp_monk_heal_leg|My leg hurts with each step I take...
dlga_camp_monk_heal_head:camp_monk_pay|When I said you looked like you took a few too many hits to the head I didn't expect it to be as literal as that. Take a sit and stay straight so I can take a look at it. Mhm, I can take care of that but I'll need some material worth 200 crowns.
dlga_camp_monk_heal_arm:camp_monk_pay|Did you think for a moment to clean the wound? Lord in Heaven, a day more and you'd be a cripple. Mhm, I can take care of that but I'll need some material worth 150 crowns.
dlga_camp_monk_heal_leg:camp_monk_pay|Show me your leg. If you still want to be able to walk we'll have to clean that wound. Mhm, I can take care of that but I'll need some material worth 100 crowns.
dlga_camp_monk_pay:camp_monk_heal|Very well, here's the crowns, just hurry up it's starting to hurt badly.
dlga_camp_monk_pay:camp_monk_pay_denied|I don't have that much on me right now...
dlga_camp_monk_pay_denied:close_window|I can't heal you without the right medicine and tools, I can prevent you from dying of an infection but without the items I need you will never make a full recovery.
dlga_camp_monk_heal:close_window|Done, just be more careful next time. 
dlga_camp_monk_discuss:camp_monk_backstory_fail|You're not very friendly for a monk, what's your story?
dlga_camp_monk_backstory_fail:camp_monk_backstory_fail_2|I have God to discuss my sins, the affairs of Men don't interest me.
dlga_camp_monk_backstory_fail_2:camp_monk_backstory_fail_3|Why join my company then? A healer that avoids people seems like a contradiction to me.
dlga_camp_monk_backstory_fail_3:camp_monk_discuss|This is the best way for me to fulfill His mission, I have a debt towards Him but I don't wish to discuss it now.
dlga_camp_monk_discuss:close_window|Goodbye then.
dlga_start:depart_perededij|So, what are we waiting for?
dlga_depart_perededij:close_window|On my way, father...
dlga_start:comp_dijtropper|Speak to Father Jacob if you need something. Unless you are a mercenary that is...
dlga_comp_dijtropper:comp_dijtropper2|Mercenary, indeed. I'm {playername}.
dlga_comp_dijtropper:close_window|You are mistaken. I don't allow myself to hurt creatures of God's creation.
dlga_comp_dijtropper2:comp_dijtropper3|Good. You see, I'm seeking to join a group to practise and perfect my medical skills. It goes without saying that I won't work with a tyrant who sends troops to a certain death. Are you interested?
dlga_comp_dijtropper3:comp_dijtropperhow|Actually, a healer would be of great use to me. You could stay in my camp to treat the wounded. What do you want in exchange?
dlga_comp_dijtropper3:close_window|I need fighters, not a priest. Thank you...
dlga_comp_dijtropperhow:comp_dijtropperhowok|I don't need crowns but you could make a donation to the church, give me bread and ale in exchange for my services and the church would let me go. I expect food and shelter in your camp as well as the tools needed for my trade.
dlga_comp_dijtropperhowok:close_window|This is your bread and ale, Father. Join my company if you wish.
dlga_comp_dijtropperhowok:close_window.1|In that case, I'll come back with the goods.
dlga_start:camp_tailor_discuss|Hello {playername}, what can I do for you?
dlga_camp_tailor_discuss:camp_tailor_custom_armor_start|Can you modify my equipment?
dlga_camp_tailor_discuss:camp_tailor_banter|Your prices seem higher than the ones in town.
dlga_camp_tailor_discuss:close_window|Nothing for now.
dlga_camp_tailor_banter:camp_tailor_banter_end|We're not in town are we?It's much more difficult to get resupplied in a camp, I can't make a contract with most suppliers without having a proper shop. So I have to pay a higher price for all the materials I purchase.
dlga_camp_tailor_banter_end:close_window|On the other hand I guarantee you that my work is of superior quality in spite of the conditions and that I offer a better selection than most towns.
dlga_camp_tailor_custom_armor_start:camp_tailor_custom_armor_ask|Certainly, what did you have in mind?
dlga_camp_tailor_custom_armor_ask:camp_tailor_custom_armor_choose|{s1}
dlga_camp_tailor_custom_armor_ask:close_window|Nevermind.
dlga_camp_tailor_custom_armor_choose:camp_tailor_custom_armor_confirm|{playername}, I'll need {reg0} crowns to make up for the materials.
dlga_camp_tailor_custom_armor_confirm:camp_tailor_finish|Fine by me.
dlga_camp_tailor_custom_armor_confirm:close_window|I can't afford it at the moment.
dlga_camp_tailor_custom_armor_confirm:close_window.1|Perhaps later.
dlga_camp_tailor_finish:close_window|{playername}, consider it done.
dlga_start:comp_limoges_leave|I packed my tools and personnal belonging, just help me carry this crate.
dlga_comp_limoges_leave:close_window|Let's move...
dlga_start:comp_limoges_greeting|Greetings {sir/madam}, what brings you to a siege workshop?
dlga_comp_limoges_greeting:comp_limoge_role|What do you do here?
dlga_comp_limoges_greeting:comp_limoges_trade|Simple curiosity, do you have any pieces for sale?
dlga_comp_limoges_greeting:close_window|I just got lost, I thought this was the tavern.
dlga_comp_limoges_trade:comp_limoges_trade_cont|We do, the bigger pieces are only on command though. Talk to the Master Engineer if you want to purchase a handgonne.
dlga_comp_limoges_trade_cont:comp_limoges_trade_question|What's a handgonne?
dlga_comp_limoges_trade_cont:close_window|I'll speak to him them.
dlga_comp_limoges_trade_question:comp_limoges_trade_question_end|A hand cannon, a firearm. It's like a crossbow but much more powerful, noisy and... expensive.
dlga_comp_limoges_trade_question_end:close_window|That's quite interesting.
dlga_comp_limoge_role:comp_limoge_hire|I'm the Master Engineer's assistant, not for long as he has taken another apprentice. I've previously learned smithing, tailoring and tanning. Now I'm thinking of seeking employment until I can afford my own workshop.
dlga_comp_limoge_hire:comp_limoge_hire_cont|You could work for me, there's always plenty to do in a camp.
dlga_comp_limoge_hire:close_window|Good luck then.
dlga_comp_limoge_hire_cont:comp_limoge_hire_cont_2|I don't see why not... It would allow me to travel a bit, see the world before I decide where to settle.
dlga_comp_limoge_hire_cont_2:comp_limoge_hire_end|We'll sign a contract of dwelling, protection, access to food and to a workshop as well as a payment of 100 crowns up front.
dlga_comp_limoge_hire_end:close_window|Alright but no special treatment outside of having your workshop.
dlga_comp_limoge_hire_end:close_window.1|I need to think about this.
dlga_start:camp_merchant_discuss|Buongiorno {playername}! What can I do for you amico mio?

dlga_camp_merchant_discuss:close_window|Nothing for now.
dlga_camp_merchant_banter:camp_merchant_banter_end|Bene {playername}, I hope to make enough profit to return to Italy. No offense, things are a bit too wild here.
dlga_camp_merchant_banter_end:close_window|Not enought for my taste!

dlga_comp_paris_greeting:comp_paris_discuss|Spit it out, merchant, crook, whoever you are I can smell it's a scam.
dlga_comp_paris_greeting:close_window|Go bother someone else.
dlga_comp_paris_discuss:comp_paris_discuss_cont|Molto bene, I'm a merchant of good reputation I swear! I just need an investor to get my caravan bussiness going again.
dlga_comp_paris_discuss_cont:comp_paris_discuss_cont_2|Let me guess, I just happen to look like the right person for it?
dlga_comp_paris_discuss_cont:close_window|Ah! Heard that one before, I'm not falling for it.
dlga_comp_paris_discuss_cont_2:comp_paris_discuss_cont_3|{Signore/Signora} per favore! I understand the skepticism, I've been stuck here for days trying to look for someone to help me out but I'm stuck here since my little misadventure.
dlga_comp_paris_discuss_cont_3:comp_paris_discuss_cont_4|Giovanni Conti is my name and I am a merchant from Firenze. My caravan got sacked by those cruel scuoiatori, flayers as you call them, I managed to run away with my life but I lost everything I had.
dlga_comp_paris_discuss_cont_4:comp_paris_discuss_hire|I'm trying to set up a new caravan but I don't have the means for it. I'm trying to leave this wretched place but I can't... Of the very few caravans that cross this place, none is taking in new members.
dlga_comp_paris_discuss_hire:comp_paris_hire_cont|I'm not going to invest in a stranger but if you want I have a camp.
dlga_comp_paris_discuss_hire:close_window|I've heard better sob stories.
dlga_comp_paris_hire_cont:comp_paris_hire_cont_2|Grazie, I'll do it just to leave this place but that doesn't get me back on bussiness. You see, I'm not the fighting type, do you get me? I pray you listen to my following offer.
dlga_comp_paris_hire_cont_2:comp_paris_hire_end|500 crows, that's all I'm asking. I buy some goods and join your camp, I set up shop there and trade with you and the places we visit. Cosa dice?
dlga_comp_paris_hire_end:close_window|Deal. Here's the money but I'm accompanying you until we reach the camp.

dlga_mess_calais_start1:mess_calais_direp|I'm interested, tell me more.
dlga_mess_calais_start1:close_window|I'm not a messenger, thank you.
dlga_mess_calais_direp:mess_calais_qa|What do you want to know?
dlga_mess_calais_qa:mess_calais_paye|How much will I get paid?
dlga_mess_calais_qa:mess_calais_go|Do you have a letter or a package to deliver?
dlga_mess_calais_qa:mess_calais_cons|Do you have any advice to give me about the Art of being a Messenger?
dlga_mess_calais_qa:mess_calais_fran|Are there any other Guilds of Messengers in France?
dlga_mess_calais_qa:close_window|That's all I wanted to know, thank you.
dlga_mess_calais_paye:mess_calais_qa|The distance does not matter, you will always be paid 150 crowns, it is the price of a circuit all over France, whether a letter is for a shoe maker who expects news of his family,  or even if it is for the king himself, it is the same rate.
dlga_mess_calais_fran:mess_calais_qa|Of course, there is one in Calais, in Bourges, Bordeaux and Marseille, if you are going to give a letter to a customer of Marseille, go to the representative of the Guild of this city to give you in turn a race, so you will not come back empty handed and  The circuit will become profitable, think about it.
dlga_mess_calais_cons:mess_calais_cons2|Well, to bring a letter is not difficult in itself, but to travel as much distance as quickly as possible avoiding the bandit groups is not the easiest, travelling on deforested plains is often safer than crossing woods, you would not see Bandits in ambush that way too late.
dlga_mess_calais_cons2:mess_calais_cons3|But you can't afford to be sightseeing, a safer path is always longer, but the customer is waiting and that makes less money for you. Moreover I advise you to travel alone or with two or three other companions only, it is better to be quick to escape the bandits than to be accompanied by an escort that would slow you down, anyway, you could not pay guards of Mercenaries with your income, the Messenger life is simple, and made journeys of discoveries, but also full of dangers so be always on your guard.
dlga_mess_calais_cons3:prmess_calais_qa|And finally, I recommend you find a fast mount, even if it is a bit expensive, it represents a good investment to be able to complete the circuit faster. The messenger is clever above all, avoids pitfalls and knows how to take advantage of every situation.
dlga_prmess_calais_qa:mess_calais_qa|Do you have any other questions?

dlga_mmess_calais_cons2:mmess_calais_cons3|But you can't afford to be sightseeing, a safer path is always longer, but the customer is waiting and that makes less money for you. Moreover I advise you to travel alone or with two or three other companions only, it is better to be quick to escape the bandits than to be accompanied by an escort that would slow you down, anyway, you could not pay guards of Mercenaries with your income, the Messenger life is simple, and made journeys of discoveries, but also full of dangers so be always on your guard.
dlga_mmess_calais_cons3:mprmess_calais_qa|And finally, I recommend you find a fast mount, even if it is a bit expensive, it represents a good investment to be able to complete the circuit faster. The messenger is clever above all, avoids pitfalls and knows how to take advantage of every situation.
dlga_mprmess_calais_qa:mmess_calais_qa|Do you have any other questions?
dlga_mmess_calais_go:mmess_sort_script|Of course, you see there will always be more letters or packages to deliver than messengers, I just happen to have one right here.
dlga_mmess_sort_script:mmess_calais_direp2|Yes, I have a letter that must reach the Guild master of the merchants of Montpellier as soon as possible, do you accept this circuit?
dlga_mmess_calais_direp2:mmess_calais_deeprd|All right, I'll get it to Montpellier
dlga_mmess_calais_direp2:mmess_calais_direp2dd|I'm sorry, but I can't.

dlga_dial_camp_base_1:jeu_descamp_1|Let's play dice for crowns...
dlga_dial_camp_base_1:entrainement_refus|If you are cold, a little training will heat you up.
dlga_entrainement_refus:close_window|Well, all accounts are made, captain, don't be so cold.
dlga_dial_camp_base_1:close_window|Stay on your guard...
dlga_jeu_descamp_1:generique_des|I was going to ask you, we were going to die here.
dlga_start:dial_camp_base_12|I am a bit on edge because I do not like to have to fight in the forest.
dlga_dial_camp_base_12:jeu_pile_face_generique_2|Let's play for some crowns...
dlga_dial_camp_base_12:foret_combat|In the forest or elsewhere, the main thing is that we are superior in number or quality.
dlga_foret_combat:close_window|Well said Captain! Let's hope we match one of the two cases.
dlga_dial_camp_base_12:close_window|Stay cautious, even if we are hidden in the forest, other troops could hide there too...
dlga_jeu_pile_face_generique_2:generique_des|Excellent idea! Nothing better to relax.
dlga_start:dial_camp_base_13|Captain... you should relax, we're watching the camp. Why don't you go around and look?
dlga_dial_camp_base_13:jeu_pile_face_generique_3|Let's play for some crowns...
dlga_dial_camp_base_13:environs_campagne|You're right, I'm going to explore the surroundings.
dlga_environs_campagne:close_window|All right, if we hear riders, we'll sound the alarm.
dlga_dial_camp_base_13:close_window|We leave soon, no need to wait.
dlga_jeu_pile_face_generique_3:generique_des|Finally a little relaxation.
dlga_start:dial_camp_base_14|What beautiful confines, isn't it, captain?
dlga_dial_camp_base_14:jeu_pile_face_generique_4|Let's play for crowns...
dlga_dial_camp_base_14:belles_contres|Are you from around here?
dlga_belles_contres:close_window|No, but if I live long enough to have enough crowns, I would look for a land not far from here. .
dlga_dial_camp_base_14:close_window|We're leaving soon.
dlga_jeu_pile_face_generique_4:generique_des|Good idea captain, if you have the crowns to lose, I would never have enough.
dlga_start:dial_camp_discute_1p|My lord... Finally, captain as they say, I do not know too much how it is that we must call you, I was just peasant sometimes, and here I am, armed... what a story!
dlga_pre_dial_camp_discute:dial_camp_discute_1p|Anything else, Captain? Is that right (captain)?
dlga_dial_camp_discute_1p:dial_camp_discute_simple|Call me what you feel at the moment.
dlga_dial_camp_discute_1p:dial_camp_discute_captaine|Captain will suffice for now... and behave like an infantryman.
dlga_dial_camp_discute_1p:close_window|See you later...
dlga_dial_camp_discute_simple:dial_camp_discute_simple_2|Well that!... you're like a comrade to me, my lord. Ho I would follow your orders of course, but it is with admiration that I would do, nothing like a frank camaraderie!.
dlga_dial_camp_discute_simple_2:dial_camp_discute_simple_3|Nothing like that is true, and if you told me your story...
dlga_dial_camp_discute_simple_2:close_window|Good, see you later, I have things to do.
dlga_dial_camp_discute_simple_3:dial_camp_discute_simple_4|I was born in the north of France, near Caen, I work in the fields since I was park, then when the Anglois arrived, I left leaving my village, I took a job in the village where you saw me for the first time , and now I'm here? Talking about it with you... nothing interesting, but I never thought I would become a soldier.
dlga_dial_camp_discute_simple_4:pre_dial_camp_discute|Don't worry, everything's going to be all right.
dlga_dial_camp_discute_captaine:pre_dial_camp_discute|Well... Of course captain, I would make efforts... still efforts. (mutters something underneath his beard).
dlga_start:dial_camp_travail|Capitaine...I must take care of the horses, then I must sharpen the weapons.
dlga_pre_dial_camp_foret_2:dial_camp_travail|Anything else to tell me, Captain?
dlga_dial_camp_travail:dial_camp_travail_2|Don't forget to rest.
dlga_dial_camp_travail:dial_camp_tyran_foret|So hurry up a little.
dlga_dial_camp_travail:dial_camp_discute_histoire|Do you know a story... an anecdote?.
dlga_dial_camp_travail:close_window|Continue in this case.
dlga_dial_camp_travail_2:dial_camp_bruit_foret|Rest?.. Indeed captain, it's important that too, but how to close the eye with the sound of the forest?.
dlga_dial_camp_bruit_foret:dial_camp_bruit_foret_22|Try to fall asleep, why not after a little chat with your comrades?
dlga_dial_camp_bruit_foret:close_window|Sleep as much as possible, I need all your strength, and no excess drink to sleep more easily.
dlga_dial_camp_bruit_foret_22:dial_camp_bruit_foret_21|It is exactly that... they are all afraid of the forest, and communicate to me their fear, it will not help me to fall asleep.
dlga_dial_camp_bruit_foret_21:dial_camp_bruit_foret_23|Think of another place, like the tavern.
dlga_dial_camp_bruit_foret_21:pre_dial_camp_foret_2|Stop with that, you're not children anymore.
dlga_dial_camp_bruit_foret_23:pre_dial_camp_foret_2|Ho!... This is a great idea captain, you are very strong, I see it.
dlga_dial_camp_tyran_foret:close_window|Well, well, I could do faster if you don't get in the way.
dlga_dial_camp_discute_histoire:dial_camp_foret_fear|If, now that you tell me, someone from the troop told me that not far from this forest, lives a strange witch. They say that she boils cats to make potions. Someone from the village saw her, and she quickly become a black wolf and ran through the woods!
dlga_dial_camp_foret_fear:pre_dial_camp_foret_2|Don't tell that to others, okay?.
dlga_start:dial_camp_campagne|You smell that?
dlga_pre_dial_camp_campagne:dial_camp_campagne|I hope we stay tonight, I would still enjoy the smells.
dlga_dial_camp_campagne:dial_camp_campagne_2|The smell of the countryside?
dlga_dial_camp_campagne:dial_camp_tyran_campagne|If it's your own odor that you smell, go to the well and wash yourself, without delay.
dlga_dial_camp_campagne:close_window|I have to go, see you later.
dlga_dial_camp_campagne_2:dial_camp_campagne_honet|Exactly, the smell of the returned land, the crops, the vines, no life is better than that of an honest worker.
dlga_dial_camp_campagne_honet:dial_camp_vie_camppagne|It must not be so bad indeed.
dlga_dial_camp_campagne_honet:pre_dial_camp_campagne|It must be terrible to be held back somewhere, nothing better than liberty.
dlga_dial_camp_vie_camppagne:dial_camp_vie_camppagne_rep|Ho, it's true you can believe me, get up in the field at the crow of the rooster at dawn, work in the sun, and live from his toil.
dlga_dial_camp_vie_camppagne_rep:dial_camp_campagne_simpl|A simple and peaceful life.
dlga_dial_camp_vie_camppagne_rep:pre_dial_camp_campagne|Work again and again...I do not know if it is the life for me, I prefer a dangerous but more exciting life.
dlga_dial_camp_campagne_simpl:pre_dial_camp_campagne|A peaceful life yes... Then came the war, and we had to give up our burned fields and leave behind the remains of our burned farms, these dogs we will pay for it all!
dlga_dial_camp_tyran_campagne:close_window|Bha, I'll go if it's an order, but as everyone senses that smell, I didn't think it would bother anyone.
dlga_start:dial_camp_plain|Why camp on the edge of the grand route, captain?
dlga_pre_dial_camp_plain:dial_camp_plain|All right, but I still don't understand why we're camping here, with all due respect.
dlga_dial_camp_plain:dial_camp_plain_2|Why not?
dlga_dial_camp_plain:dial_camp_plain_2.1|Would you take Me for a thief by any chance? I do not want to attack the merchants rest assured.
dlga_dial_camp_plain:close_window|We'll talk about that later.
dlga_dial_camp_plain_2:dial_camp_plainenemi|No, it's just that if the enemy host went through the...
dlga_dial_camp_plainenemi:dial_camp_route|Well if the enemy has the right to take the big road why not us?
dlga_dial_camp_plainenemi:pre_dial_camp_plain|It's none of your business, let me lead and just attack the enemy.
dlga_dial_camp_route:dial_camp_route_2|I appreciate your courage, captain, but it's still very dangerous.
dlga_dial_camp_route_2:dial_camp_routefin|Sometimes you have to take the shortest ways, do not worry I have the situation in hand.
dlga_dial_camp_route_2:pre_dial_camp_plain|Camp here where elsewhere... The enemy is everywhere you know.
dlga_dial_camp_routefin:close_window|Hum...I am convinced captain, we have no choice, forgive me for doubting you.
dlga_dial_camp_route_2:close_window|Sorry, but I have things to do.
dlga_start:dial_camp_chanteur_1|Not too cold, captain?
dlga_dial_camp_chanteur_1:dial_camp_discute_chantrech|Let's sing for us to heat up.
dlga_dial_camp_chanteur_1:dial_camp_discute_jambes|I'm going to go for a walk to warm my legs.
dlga_dial_camp_discute_jambes:close_window|You might as well walk on fire, for God's sake it's cold in the north.
dlga_dial_camp_discute_chantrech:dial_camp_discute_chant_fin|Excellent idea, I can teach you a song from my village... that of memories...
dlga_dial_camp_discute_chant_fin:close_window|Let's sing and drink...
dlga_start:dial_camp_chanteur_bois|I don't like sleeping in the woods, captain.
dlga_dial_camp_chanteur_bois:dial_camp_discute_chantpens|Sing in your heart, so you won't think about it.
dlga_dial_camp_chanteur_bois:dial_camp_discute_foretpeur|There is nothing diabolical in a forest, just idiots who are afraid.
dlga_dial_camp_discute_foretpeur:close_window|Bah, if you say so, you'll be fine tonight...
dlga_dial_camp_discute_chantpens:dial_camp_discute_chantfor_2|If you want, I remember a song from my hometown.
dlga_dial_camp_discute_chantfor_2:close_window|Are you sure you didn't hear it in a tavern?
dlga_start:dial_camp_chanteur_paix|What a peaceful place it seems that there has never been war here.
dlga_dial_camp_chanteur_paix:dial_camp_discute_chant_campagne|Would you sing a melody?
dlga_dial_camp_chanteur_paix:close_window|Get some rest, see you later.
dlga_dial_camp_discute_chant_campagne:dial_camp_discute_chantfor_e2h|Yes, with pleasure, I was a troubadour.
dlga_dial_camp_discute_chantfor_e2h:close_window|I guessed your way of holding your sword.
dlga_start:dial_camp_chanteur_feu|It feels good to stop a bit and rest in front of a fire.
dlga_dial_camp_chanteur_feu:dial_camp_discute_chant_insp|Doesn't that inspire a song?
dlga_dial_camp_chanteur_feu:close_window|Enjoy, we leave soon.
dlga_dial_camp_discute_chant_insp:close_window|Of course, if it makes you happy.
dlga_start:dial_camp_sent_1|I took the first round of guard, Sir, I'm watching the camp because of the wolves.
dlga_dial_camp_sent_1:dial_camp_sent_loup|And what do you do if a pack comes into the camp?.
dlga_dial_camp_sent_1:close_window|Good luck.
dlga_dial_camp_sent_loup:dial_camp_sentloupok|Capitaine...I am not an idiot, wolves are afraid of fire, moreover if a pack attacked, I would have time to kill some of them before alerting the camp.
dlga_dial_camp_sentloupok:dial_camp_sent_anglais|That's fine, and what would you do against a pack of the English?
dlga_dial_camp_sent_anglais:close_window|Ben the same thing, except that they are not afraid of a fire.
dlga_start:dial_camp_sent_2|Have you seen it?.
dlga_dial_camp_sent_2:dial_camp_sent_cerf|Who's that?
dlga_dial_camp_sent_cerf:dial_camp_sentcerfok|A serf! Of all beauty, I almost shot him but he ran away.
dlga_dial_camp_sentcerfok:dial_camp_sent_nocerf|It was his day and not yours.
dlga_dial_camp_sent_nocerf:close_window|It's a pity.
dlga_start:close_window.7|Let's leave whenever you are ready.
dlga_start:dial_camp_sent_route|Nothing to report, the road is quiet.
dlga_dial_camp_sent_route:dial_camp_sent_marchant|Not even a merchant convoy?
dlga_dial_camp_sent_marchant:close_window|No, I hope we have everything we need.

dlga_dial_batailletent:start_tenteplanbat|What should I tell the men?

dlga_start:relative_saved_1a|Thank you! Thank you, {sir/my lady}, for rescuing me from those fiends. Did my brother in {s9} put you onto their track?
dlga_relative_saved_1a:close_window|Yes. I told him that I would find you. I advise you to return to your family as quickly as you can -- and be careful on the road.
dlga_start:bandit_leader_1a|Ay! Spare me! Spare my life! Let me go, and I'll go far away from here, and learn an honest trade, and you'll never hear of me again!
dlga_bandit_leader_1a:bandit_leader_1b|I'll spare your life -- but in exchange, I want information. Either you or your mates kidnapped the brother of a prominent merchant in town. Tell me where you're hiding him, and give me your word that you'll stop troubling the people of these parts, and you can go free.
dlga_start:looter_leader_1|What do you want?
dlga_looter_leader_1:looter_leader_2|I've been looking for you. Tell me where you keep your prisoners, and I'll let you go.
dlga_looter_leader_1:close_window|Nothing. We'll leave you in peace.
dlga_looter_leader_2:looter_leader_3|Hah! Those prisoners are only going free if you pay their ransom. Did you bring any silver?
dlga_looter_leader_3:close_window|No, but I brought steel.
dlga_bandit_leader_1b:close_window|Oh bless you, {sir/my lady}. Bless you. We've done the lad no harm. We've been keeping him in our hideout near {s9}. I'll describe the area nearby in detail, so there's no mistaking it...
dlga_start:rescue_prisoner_succeed_2|{playername}, you saved him! Thank you ever so much for rescuing my {s11}. Please, take this as some small repayment for your noble deed.
dlga_rescue_prisoner_succeed_2:lord_pretalk|Always an honour to serve, {s65}.
dlga_start_up_quest_1_next:close_window|Are you all right? Well.... I guess you're alive, at any rate. I'm not sure that we can say the same for the other fellow. That's one less thief to trouble our streets at night, although Heaven knows he won't be the last.... Anyway, maybe you can help me with something. Let's talk more inside. Out here, we don't know who's listening
dlga_start:merchant_quest_2a|Splendid work. You have hired enough men to take on the bandits. Now -- travellers entering {s9} have told us that there is a small group of robbers lurking on the outside of town. I suspect that they are all from the same band, the one that took my brother. Hunt them down and defeat them, and make them disclose the location of their lair!
dlga_start:merchant_quest_3a|So, you've found out where they hid my brother? Splendid work. I flatter myself that I'm a fine judge of character, and you look to be a {man/woman} who can get things done. Now, go out and save his unworthy hide!
dlga_start:merchant_quest_3b|Well... My brother is home safe. I'm not sure what to do with him -- maybe pack him off to a university in Italy. That way, if he gets knocked on the head in a street brawl, no one can say it's my fault. But that's not your problem. Here's the rest of your reward. It was well-earned.
dlga_merchant_quest_3b:merchant_quest_4a|The money is most welcome, and I am glad to have been of service
dlga_merchant_quest_4a:merchant_quest_4b|Good! Now... Are you interested in making some more?
dlga_merchant_quest_4b:merchant_quest_4b1|Possibly. What do you need?
dlga_merchant_quest_4b1:merchant_quest_4b2|Remember how I told you that the bandits had an ally inside the walls? I think I know who it is -- the captain of the watch, no less. Some months ago this captain, seeing the amount of profit we merchants were making from trade across the frontiers, decided to borrow some money to sponsor a caravan. Unfortunately, like many who are new to commerce, he failed to realize that great profit only comes with great risk. So he sank all his money into the most expensive commodities, and of course his caravan was captured and looted, and he lost everything.
dlga_merchant_quest_4b2:merchant_quest_4b3|As a consequence, it seems, our captain turned to villainy to recoup his fortune. I supposed I'd do the same if, the Heavens forbid, I ever faced indebtedness and ruination. Now, any watch captain worth his salary will have a few thieves and robbers on his payroll, to inform on the rest, but our captain decides to employ these bastards wholesale. He brings them into the town, lets them do as they will, and takes a share of their take. You've heard of poachers turning gamekeepers? Well, in the unfortunate land of France, sometimes gamekeepers will turn poacher. Luckily, there's are still a few brave, honest souls in the watch who've told me how he works.
dlga_merchant_quest_4b3:merchant_quest_4b4|Now -- here's my plan. I could bring this to the attention of {s4}, lord of the city, but that would mean an inquiry, my word against the captain's, and witnesses can be bought and evidence destroyed, or maybe the whole thing will be forgotten if the enemy comes across the border again, and all I'll get for my trouble is a knife in the ribs. In time of war, you see, a king's eye wanders far from his domain, and his subjects suffer. So I've got another idea. I've got a small group of townsfolk together, some men in my employ and some others who've lost relatives to these bandits, and we'll storm the captain's home and bring him in chains before {s4}, hopefully with a few captured bandits to explain how things stack up.
dlga_merchant_quest_4b4:merchant_quest_4b5|All I need now is someone to lead my little army into battle -- and I can't think of anyone better than you. So, what do you say?
dlga_merchant_quest_4b5:merchant_quest_4b6|How do I know that you're telling me the truth?
dlga_merchant_quest_4b6:merchant_quest_4b7|Oh, well, I suppose it's possible that I found a dozen bandits who were willing to give their lives to give a passing stranger a false impression of life in old {s4}... Well, I guess you can't really know if my word is good, but I reckon you've learned by now that my money is good, and there's another 100 crowns, or maybe a bit more, that's waiting for you if you'll do me this last little favor. So what do you say?
dlga_merchant_quest_4b7:merchant_quest_4b8|All right. I'll lead your men.
dlga_merchant_quest_4b7:merchant_quest_4_decline|I'm sorry. This is too much, too fast. I need time to think.
dlga_merchant_quest_4b8:merchant_quest_4b9|Splendid. It's been a long time since I staked so much on a single throw of the dice, and frankly I find it exhilarating. My men are ready to move on your word. Are you ready?
dlga_merchant_quest_4b9:merchant_quest_4_accept|Yes. Give them the sign.
dlga_merchant_quest_4b9:merchant_quest_4_decline|Not now. I will need to rest before I can fight again.
dlga_merchant_quest_4_accept:close_window|Good! Now -- strike hard, strike fast, and the captain and his henchmen won't know what hit them. May the heavens be with you!
dlga_merchant_quest_4_decline:close_window|Right. I can keep my men standing by. If you let this go too long, then I suppose that I shall have to finish this affair without you, but I would be most pleased if you could be part of it as well. For now, take what time you need.
dlga_merchant_quest_2a:close_window|Very well. I shall hunt for bandits.
dlga_merchant_quest_2a:merchant_quest_2a_whynotcome|Why don't you come with us?
dlga_merchant_quest_2a_whynotcome:merchant_quest_2a|Because I'm paying you to go take care of it. That's the short answer. The long answer is that I've got some leads to follow up here in town, and I have just as much chance of getting knocked on my head as you, if that's what you're asking. But I respect your question. Now, what do you say?
dlga_merchant_quest_2a:close_window.1|I cannot deal with this matter at this time.
dlga_merchant_quest_3a:close_window|Very well. I go now to attack the bandits in their lair, and find your brother.
dlga_merchant_quest_3a:close_window.1|I cannot deal with this matter at this time.
dlga_start:merchant_quest_persuasion|You may do as you wish, {sir/my lady}, but I am disappointed. You would do well to reconsider. I am a rich men, and would show you my gratitude in coin.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuasion:merchant_quest_1_prologue_3|You make a persuasive case. I will help you.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuasion:merchant_quest_2|You make a persuasive case. I will help you.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuasion:merchant_quest_3|You make a persuasive case. I will help you.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuasion:merchant_quest_4b8|You make a persuasive case. I will help you.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuasion:close_window|As I say, I have more important business elsewhere.
dlga_merchant_quest_2:merchant_quest_2a|Now -- go find and defeat that group of bandits.
dlga_merchant_quest_3:merchant_quest_3a|Now -- go attack that bandit hideout, get my brother back, and show those brigands what happens to those who threaten my household.
dlga_start:close_screen|Oh -- thank the heavens... Thank the heavens... Am I safe?
dlga_start:merchant_closing_statement_2|Ah... {playername}. Things didn't go quite so well as I had hoped. {s5} couldn't quite find it in him to overlook my little breach of the peace. Oh, he's grateful enough that I got rid of his crooked captain -- a guard who'll let in bandits will let in an enemy army, if the price is right -- but he can't exactly have me running around here as a lasting reminder of his failure to take care of things himself.
dlga_merchant_closing_statement_2:merchant_closing_statement_3|That hardly seems fair...
dlga_merchant_closing_statement_3:merchant_closing_statement_4|Fair? This is France, {my boy/my lady}! Kings do what they will, and the rest of us do as they must. He didn't string me up, and instead gave me time to sell my properties -- even put in a word with the other merchants that they best pay me a fair price, too. That's gracious enough, as kings go -- but he's a weak king, as they all are here, and weak kings must always look to their authority first, and justice second. I suppose I'd do the same, in his shoes.
dlga_merchant_closing_statement_4:close_window|Anyway, I wouldn't go rubbing your part in this affair in {s5}'s face -- but he's taken note of you, and decided that you're not worth hanging, and that's something to which I'll raise a glass any day of the week. He might even have work for you, further down the road. Or, you can sell your sword to one of his competitors. Anyway, I hope you've learned a bit about what it will take to stay alive in this troubled land, and I suspect that the money you've earned won't go to waste. Good luck.
dlga_merchant_quests_last_word:close_window|I am preparing to leave town in a short while. It's been an honor to know you. Good luck.

I will permit you one final visit, to make your farewells. After that, if you persist in attempting to see her, everyone shall know that you are a man of scant honor.
dlga_start:close_window.15|How wonderful it is... In a short while we shall be married! However, I should point out that, in the remaining few days, it is not customary for us to speak too much together.
dlga_start:player_siege_castle_commander_1|What do you want?
dlga_player_siege_castle_commander_1:player_siege_ask_surrender|Surrender! Your situation is hopeless!
dlga_player_siege_castle_commander_1:close_window|Nothing. I'll leave you now.
dlga_player_siege_ask_surrender:player_siege_ask_surrender_treatment|Perhaps... Do you give your word of honour that we'll be treated well?
dlga_player_siege_ask_surrender:player_siege_ask_leave_unmolested|We are ready to leave this castle to you and march away if you give me your word of honour that you'll let us leave unmolested.
dlga_player_siege_ask_surrender:close_window|Surrender? Hah! We can hold these walls until we all die of old age.
dlga_player_siege_ask_surrender_treatment:player_siege_ask_surrender_treatment_reject|I give you nothing. Surrender now or prepare to die!
dlga_player_siege_ask_surrender_treatment_reject:close_window|Bastard. We will fight you to the last man!
dlga_player_siege_ask_surrender_treatment:player_siege_ask_surrender_treatment_accept|You will be ransomed and your soldiers will live. I give you my word.
dlga_player_siege_ask_surrender_treatment_accept:close_window|Very well then. Under those terms, I offer you my surrender.
dlga_player_siege_ask_leave_unmolested:player_siege_ask_leave_unmolested_accept|You have my word. You will not come under attack if you leave the castle.
dlga_player_siege_ask_leave_unmolested_accept:close_window|Very well. Then we leave this castle to you. You have won this day. But we'll meet again.
dlga_player_siege_ask_leave_unmolested:player_siege_ask_leave_unmolested_reject|Unacceptable. I want prisoners.
dlga_player_siege_ask_leave_unmolested_reject:close_window|Then we will defend this castle to the death, and this parley is done. Farewell.

dlga_lord_prison_break_confirm:lord_prison_break_confirm_2|Thank the heavens! I don't know how long I could have lasted in here
dlga_lord_prison_break_confirm_2:lord_prison_break_confirm_3|But wait -- how will we escape? We'll be rushed by the garrison the moment we step out that door. I can help you hold them off -- but I'll tell you now, they have fed me nothing but watery porridge and a few scraps, and I'm not as strong as I could be.
dlga_lord_prison_break_confirm_3:lord_prison_break_confirm_4|You keep well behind me, and try to stay out of the fighting.
dlga_lord_prison_break_confirm_3:lord_prison_break_confirm_4.1|I'll need you to grab a weapon and help me, despite your weakness.

dlga_pretender_intro_1:pretender_intro_2|My name is {playername}. At your service.
dlga_pretender_intro_1:pretender_intro_2.1|I am {playername}. Perhaps you have heard of my exploits.
dlga_pretender_intro_2:pretender_intro_3|{s48}
dlga_pretender_intro_3:pretender_rebellion_cause_1|I thought {s12} was ruled by {s11}?
dlga_start:pretender_start|Greetings, {playername}
dlga_pretender_start:pretender_rebellion_cause_prelim|What was your story again, {reg65?my lady:sir}?
dlga_pretender_rebellion_cause_prelim:pretender_rebellion_cause_1|I shall tell you.

dlga_pretender_rebellion_cause_2:pretender_rebellion_cause_3|{s48}
dlga_pretender_rebellion_cause_3:pretender_start|{s48}
dlga_pretender_start:pretender_discuss_rebellion_1|I want to take up your cause and help you reclaim your throne!
dlga_pretender_start:pretender_end|I must leave now.
dlga_pretender_discuss_rebellion_1:pretender_discuss_rebellion_2a|Are you sure you will be up to the task, {playername}? Reclaiming my throne will be no simple matter. The lords of our realm have all sworn oaths of homage to {s11}. Such oaths to a usurper are of course invalid, and we can expect some of the lords to side with us, but it will be a very tough and challenging struggle ahead.
dlga_pretender_discuss_rebellion_2a:pretender_discuss_rebellion_2|{s11}
dlga_pretender_discuss_rebellion_2:pretender_discuss_rebellion_3|I am ready for this struggle.
dlga_pretender_discuss_rebellion_2:pretender_end|You are right. Perhaps, I should think about this some more.
dlga_pretender_discuss_rebellion_3:close_window|I have no doubt that your support for my cause is heartfelt, {playername}, and I am grateful to you for it. But I don't think we have much of a chance of success. If you can gain renown in the battlefield and make a name for yourself as a great commander, then our friends would not hesitate to join our cause, and our enemies would be wary to take up arms against us. When that time comes, I will come with you gladly. But until that time, it will be wiser not to openly challange the usurper, {s11}.
dlga_pretender_discuss_rebellion_3:close_window.1|Haven't you already taken up the cause of {s17}? You must have a very strong sense of justice, indeed. But no, thank you. I will not be part of your game.
dlga_pretender_discuss_rebellion_3:close_window.2|{playername}, you are already oath-bound to serve {s15}. As such, I cannot allow you to take up my cause, and let my enemies claim that I am but a mere puppet of {s16}. No, if I am to have the throne of {s17}, I must do it due to the righteousness of my cause and the support of my subjects alone. If you want to help me, you must first free yourself of your oath to {s15}.
dlga_pretender_discuss_rebellion_3:close_window.3|You are a monarch in your own right, {sir/my lady}. If you were to back me, I would be merely your puppet.
dlga_pretender_discuss_rebellion_3:pretender_rebellion_ready|You are a capable warrior, {playername}, and I am sure with your renown as a commander, and my righteous cause, the nobles and the good people of {s12} will flock to our support. The time is ripe for us to act! I will come with you, and together, we will topple the usurper {s11} and take the throne from his bloodied hands. But first, you must give me your oath of homage and accept me as your liege {reg65?lady:lord}.
dlga_pretender_rebellion_ready:lord_give_oath_2|I am ready to pledge myself to your cause, {reg3?my lady:sir}.
dlga_pretender_rebellion_ready:pretender_end|Let us bide our time a little longer.
dlga_lord_give_conclude_2:close_window|Forward, then! Our first task is to take hold of a fortress and persuade other lords to join us. You lead the way!
dlga_pretender_end:close_window|Farewell for now, then.
dlga_start:lord_event_choose_friend|I heard that you have befriended that {s43} called {s6}. Believe me, you can't trust that man. You should end your dealings with him.
dlga_lord_event_choose_friend:lord_event_choose_friend_renounce|I assure you, {s65}, I am no friend of {s6}.
dlga_lord_event_choose_friend_renounce:lord_pretalk|Glad news, {playername}. I would fear for your safety otherwise. If you do encounter {s6}, be on your guard and don't believe a word.
dlga_lord_event_choose_friend:lord_event_choose_friend_defend|{s6} is an honourable man, you've no right to speak of him thus.
dlga_lord_event_choose_friend_defend:lord_pretalk|As you like, {playername}. A fool you might be, but a loyal fool at the least. {s6}'s loyalty may not be so steadfast, however...
dlga_lord_event_choose_friend:lord_event_choose_friend_neutral|I don't want to be involved in your quarrel with {s6}.
dlga_lord_event_choose_friend_neutral:lord_pretalk|Hmph. As you wish, {playername}. Just remember that a {man/woman} needs friends in this world, and you'll never make any if you never stand with anyone.
dlga_start:lord_start.4|Yes, my wife?
dlga_start:lord_start.5|Yes, {sire/my lady}?
dlga_start:lord_start.6|It is good to see you, old friend
dlga_start:lord_invite_player_monarch_1|Well, {playername}. I am willing to forgive your impudence in proclaiming yourself {king/queen}, and will welcome you into my realm with full honor, as one of my vassals. Shall we proceed to the oath of allegiance?
dlga_lord_invite_player_monarch_1:lord_invite_2|Yes... my lord.
dlga_lord_invite_player_monarch_1:lord_enter_service_reject|No. That oath sticks in my throat.
dlga_start:lord_invite_1|{playername}, I've been expecting you. Word has reached my ears of your exploits. Why, I keep hearing such tales of prowess and bravery that my mind was quickly made up. I knew that I had found someone worthy of becoming my vassal.
dlga_lord_invite_1:lord_invite_2|Thank you, {s65}, you honour me with your offer.
dlga_lord_invite_1:lord_invite_2.1|It is good to have my true value recognised.
dlga_lord_invite_2:lord_invite_3|Aye. Let us dispense with the formalities, {playername}; are you ready to swear homage to me?
dlga_lord_invite_3:lord_give_oath_2|Yes, {s65}.
dlga_lord_invite_3:lord_enter_service_reject|No, {s65}. I cannot serve you right now.
dlga_start:lord_female_pc_marriage_proposal|My lady, I have been giving much thought to our recent conversation. It is time for me to ask. Would you do me the honor of becoming my wife?
dlga_lord_female_pc_marriage_proposal:lord_marriage_proposal_female_pc_next_step|Yes. I would.
dlga_lord_female_pc_marriage_proposal:lord_female_pc_marriage_proposal_postponed|Let me think about this some more.
dlga_lord_female_pc_marriage_proposal:lord_female_pc_marriage_proposal_rejected|No. I have decided that it would not be appropriate
dlga_lord_female_pc_marriage_proposal_postponed:lord_start|Of course, my lady. Take all the time you need.
dlga_lord_female_pc_marriage_proposal_rejected:lord_female_pc_marriage_proposal_rejected_confirm|Do you mean to reject my suit outright, my lady?
dlga_lord_female_pc_marriage_proposal_rejected_confirm:lord_female_pc_marriage_proposal_rejected_confirm_yes|Yes. I do.
dlga_lord_female_pc_marriage_proposal_rejected_confirm:lord_female_pc_marriage_proposal_postponed|No, you misunderstand. I just need some more time to think
dlga_lord_female_pc_marriage_proposal_rejected_confirm_yes:close_window|Well, in that case, let me tell you something -- with those harsh words, you have removed the scales from my eyes. I would agree that it would not be appropriate for me to marry one such as you. Good day, my lady.
dlga_lord_female_pc_marriage_proposal_rejected_confirm_yes:close_window.1|Such is your right, my lady. If you ever wished to reconsider, I would be overwhelmed with joy.
dlga_start:lord_start.7|My lady, it brings my heart great joy to see you again...
dlga_start:lord_start.8|My lady, I am always your humble servant.
dlga_start:lord_start.9|If it isn't my brave champion, {playername}...

dlga_lord_meet_neutral_jeanne:lord_intro_jeanne|I'm {playername}.
dlga_lord_meet_neutral_jeanne:lord_intro_jeanne.1|I'm {playername}, madame... at your service.
dlga_lord_meet_neutral_jeanne:lord_intro_jeanne.2|I'm {playername}, and I'm not really a knight...
dlga_lord_intro_jeanne:lordnolord_jeanne|I know you'll one day make a great knight. Come see me again when you've been knighted. I have big plans for you... and for France.
dlga_lordnolord_jeanne:lord_start|It seems... can we talk about other things, please?
dlga_lord_intro_jeanne:lord_jeanne|France needs brave warriors such as you. Hear the voice of heaven and join under this banner, together we will free this country and all the people who suffer.
dlga_lord_jeanne:lord_intro_jeanne_ber|Are you this shepherdess that everyone speaks about, Joan from Domrémy?
dlga_lord_jeanne:lord_start|I carry my own banner or that of the king.
dlga_lord_intro_jeanne_ber:lord_introjj|Well, if I wasn't a shepherdess I could be offended.
dlga_lord_introjj:lord_introjj2|Do you have an action to suggest?
dlga_lord_introjj:lord_start|I have other more urgent tasks to do.
dlga_lord_introjj2:lord_introjj2quest|I hear voices, they come from St. Michael. He told me to lead the people of France and kick the Englishmen out of our country. Join me in my fight and I will lead you to big victory.

dlga_lord_meet_neutral_duc:lord_intro_Ducnorespet.1|I am {playername}.
dlga_lord_intro_duc:lord_intro_insultduc|I guess you're one of the mercenaries I enlisted to fight those French dogs...
dlga_lord_intro_Ducnorespet:lord_introducreponsse|Usually only two categories of soldiers are sent to me, my allies and my enemies ... where do you stand?
dlga_lord_introducreponsse:lord_intro|I'm with you... great Duke.
dlga_lord_introducreponsse:lord_intro.1|I'm just looking for work. I'm not really a soldier and I won't make history.
dlga_lord_introducreponsse:lord_intro.2|I work for the highest bidder.
dlga_lord_intro_insultduc:lord_intro_insultduc2|I'm a mercenary, working for the French.
dlga_lord_intro_insultduc:lord_intro|You are correct, my Lord...
dlga_lord_intro_insultduc2:lord_intro|What insolence... the soldiers of your kind are only carrions who loot the corpses on the battlefield, to pay for drink in taverns... However, since your lives have a price and I happen to need vultures like you, I'm willing to listen.
dlga_start:lord_meet_neutral_ducb|Who are you, clown?
dlga_lord_meet_neutral_ducb:lord_intro_ducbmsduc|I'm {playername}, respected Duke. A mercenary, the best one you can find.

dlga_lord_intro_ducbmsduc:lord_intro_ducbmsduc2|Your excellency? Well it isn't quite according to the protocol, but certainly I'll settle for this as greetings. Although you have no rights to even greet me. A mercenary you say?... Um, where are you from?
dlga_lord_intro_pasmanant:lord_intro_ducbmsduc2|Really... and where have you been?
dlga_lord_intro_ducbmsduc2:lord_intro_ducbmsduc3d|From all over my lord. I have traveled to find a cause or gold, or both.
dlga_lord_intro_ducbmsduc3d:lord_intro_ducbmsduc3|It's good, I need mercenary of the kind that you describe. You'll be well paid for work of the highest importance, or you die trying. Are you ready to take on a mercenary contract?
dlga_lord_intro_ducbmsduc3:lord_intro_ducbmsducstart|My sword is yours, my lord.
dlga_lord_intro_ducbmsduc3:lord_intro_ducbmsducend|All in all... that seems to be a certain death. I have to reconsider.
dlga_lord_intro_ducbmsducend:close_window|Well stop wasting my time in that case.
dlga_lord_intro_ducbmsducstart:lord_intro_ducbmsducstart2|Well, first of all I need a mercenary who can stop the Englishmen, because I have little confidence in any of my subjects at the present. The house of de Penthièvre in Brittany want my destruction. My titles and my possessions, nothing less. Étienne de Penthièvre is behind this, he formed militias and siege units under my very eyes as if it was nothing. Then one day he was ready to put his plan in action.
dlga_lord_intro_ducbmsducstart2:lord_intro_ducbmsducstart3|His shock troops burn crops, farmers in their beds and cattle in barns. His other agents are eager to go and spread rumours in the nearby village taverns that the current Duke does nothing for them. Do I need to continue? His shock troops were located in the Lorges forest. I rallied my troops there, but they evaded justice. Rampant corruption among my besieging forces is enabling them to move in spite of everything being clamped down. Or is it something else... that is for you to discover in my name.
dlga_lord_intro_ducbmsducstart3:lord_intro_ducbmsducfin|Currently no resources come to me from my iron mine in the heart of the forest. Go out there and find out why. Come back alive and you will be paid beyond your wildest dreams. Do you understand mercenary?
dlga_lord_intro_ducbmsducfin:lord_intro_ducbmsducfinfin|Perfectly... my lord.
dlga_lord_intro_ducbmsducfinfin:close_window|Yes... well, here's a pass that allows you to enter the forest of Lorges. Your turn now. Don't get me wrong, you're not the only one I've sent. Just no-one has came back.

dlga_lair_quest_intermediate_2:lord_pretalk|Well, {playername}, I guess that at least some of those brigands eluded you -- and of course, it will be the peaceful travellers of this land who will pay the price. Still, it was good of you to try.

dlga_take_itemjeanneswordok:lord_pretalk|Yes, that's right, just like the voices described it to me. Thank you very much, my friend. You should join me in the attack I'm about to launch. This is the last mission I have for you, if you agree.
dlga_lord_start:avez_itemjeannesword|Do you have the sword, my friend? Time is short, the Englishmen will eventually march to the south of France.

dlga_avez_itemjeanneswordenno:lord_pretalk|Well, I'll find someone else, but know that my voices told me to ask you personally.
dlga_lord_start:eppe_dejeanne_start|{playername}, I have a favor to ask from you.

dlga_eppe_dejeanne_start2:eppe_dejeanne_start3|Don't be afraid. You are not risking death. Just a fetch quest, however it's very important that you aren't robbed on your way back.  
dlga_eppe_dejeanne_start3:eppe_dejeanne_start3ok|Tell me more.
dlga_eppe_dejeanne_start3:lord_pretalk|Not enough time, I'm sorry, but I can't take part.
dlga_eppe_dejeanne_start3ok:eppe_dejeanne_start3sure|It's a sword. I'm not sure, but you should be able to find it at the chapel of St. Catherine of Fierbois, south of Tours.
dlga_eppe_dejeanne_start3sure:eppe_dejeanne_start3sureoui|You're not sure?
dlga_eppe_dejeanne_start3sureoui:eppe_dejeanne_where|No, I mean... of course I'm sure. Just go to the chapel and bring me the sword, I beg of you.
dlga_eppe_dejeanne_where:eppe_dejeanne_where2|Where can I find it exactly?
dlga_eppe_dejeanne_where2:eppe_dejeanne_whereyes|Well... I don't know. Improvise, but bring it to me.
dlga_eppe_dejeanne_whereyes:eppe_dejeanne_whereyes22|Well, if it's possible, I'll return with it, Joan.

dlga_deu_chance_queteduc_bret:lord_pretalk|I'm sorry, your excellency, but I don't think I am ready.
dlga_deu_chance_queteduc_bretok:deu_chance_queteduc_bretok2|Well, first of all I need a mercenary who can stop the Englishmen, because I have little confidence in any of my subjects at the present. The house of de Penthièvre in Brittany want my destruction. My titles and my possessions, nothing less. Étienne de Penthièvre is behind this, he formed militias and siege units under my very eyes as if it was nothing. Then one day he was ready to put his plan in action.
dlga_deu_chance_queteduc_bretok2:deu_chance_queteduc_bretok3|His shock troops burn crops, farmers in their beds and cattle in barns. His other agents are eager to go and spread rumours in the nearby village taverns that the current Duke has no compassion for them. Do I need to continue? His shock troops were located in the Lorges forest. I rallied my troops there, but they evaded justice. Rampant corruption among my besieging forces is enabling them to move in spite of everything being clamped down. Or is it something else... that is for you to discover in my name.
dlga_deu_chance_queteduc_bretok3:deu_chance_queteduc_bretok4|Currently no resources come to me from my iron mine in the heart of the forest. Go out there and find out why. Come back alive and you will be paid beyond your wildest dreams. Do you understand mercenary?
dlga_deu_chance_queteduc_bretok4:deu_chance_queteduc_bretok5|Perfectly... your excellency.
dlga_deu_chance_queteduc_bretok5:close_window|Yes... well, here's a pass that'll allow you to enter of the Lorges forest. Your turn now. Don't get me wrong, you're not the only mercenary I've sent. None have yielded results.
dlga_lord_start:duc_mort_de_pant|Well, let's hear it.
dlga_duc_mort_de_pant:duc_mort_de_pant2|My Lord, I'm here to announce that Etienne de Penthièvre died from my hands. I'm here to collect the bounty. To prove it, here's his signet ring which I recovered from his hands.
dlga_duc_mort_de_pant2:lord_pretalk|Really? Yes, that's his ring! How is this possible? You just saved my reputation. The reward is yours, and from now on I'll regard you as my go-to person in all situations.
dlga_lord_start:duc_queteferwinp_ducfin|Well mercenary, where do you stand in this case?
dlga_duc_queteferwinp_ducfin:duc_queteferwinp_ducfin2|My lord, I found how de Penthièvre's troops escape the cordon. They have a hidden way in and out of the forest through the old mines.
dlga_duc_queteferwinp_ducfin2:lord_pretalk|Impressive, really impressive my friend. You pulled out a cursed thorn from my foot. Here's to you and know that I now consider you my best man. We will surely have other business in common, pending my troops will be able to indulge in a little extermination in this forest.
dlga_duc_queteferwinp_ducfin:lord_pretalk|This really doesn't give a good impression... here's another, try to be careful.
dlga_lord_start:info_duc_queteferencor|Well mercenary, how's our deal?
dlga_info_duc_queteferencor:lord_pretalk|I'm working, your excellency.
dlga_info_duc_queteferencor:info_duc_queteferencorperd|My lord, I'm afraid I have lost the pass to enter the Lorges forest.
dlga_info_duc_queteferencorperd:lord_pretalk|This really doesn't give a good impression... here's another, try to be careful.
dlga_lord_start:info_duc_queteferwin|Well mercenary, where do you stand in this case?
dlga_info_duc_queteferwin:info_duc_queteferwin2|My lord, I am pleased to announce that the production in your mine will resume. The bandits of de Penthièvre had ordered the serfs to cease all activity.
dlga_info_duc_queteferwin2:lord_pretalk|Dear Etienne de Penthièvre... this is surprising. I would've paid money to see his face at that moment, but we have other debts to collect. It seems to me you still have work to do, go back there.
dlga_lord_start:info_duc_quetefer|Well, mercenary?
dlga_info_duc_quetefer:lord_pretalk|I'm working, your excellency.
dlga_info_duc_quetefer:info_duc_queteferprdulp|My lord, I'm afraid I have lost the pass to enter the Lorges forest.

dlga_prem_dial_garde_pore_aubmine2:prem_dial_garde_pore_aubmine3|Really? ... Umm, in this case, I could introduce you to the chief, but need you to prove yourself. Can you kill a man that has done nothing?
dlga_prem_dial_garde_pore_aubmine3:prem_dial_garde_pore_aubminoktuer|For drink and gold? Of course.
dlga_prem_dial_garde_pore_aubmine3:prem_dial_garde_pore_aubmindiab|Why on earth?

dlga_prem_dial_garde_pore_aubminoktuer:close_window|Good answer, this is what I like to hear, haha! Listen, there's a bad guy who comes and asks questions from those women and minors. Kill him and you get to see the chief. After these fine words it's time for you to act.

dlga_win_pour_miine2:win_pour_miine3|How can I thank you? You are truly valuable mercenary!
dlga_win_pour_miine3:win_pour_miine4|Well, you can help me. On behalf of the Duke, I'm also responsible for finding out how the troops of de Penthièvre can freely pass in and out of the forest to make their misdeeds. Have you got any idea?
dlga_win_pour_miine4:win_pour_miine5|I have an idea, but I'm not sure. The miners noticed something suspicious around the old mine in the middle of the forest.
dlga_win_pour_miine5:win_pour_miine6|But now everything is clear! They must have found a passage out of the forest through the old tunnels. Go and find out.

dlga_capit_camp_win_contartde_siegechateau:capit_camp_win_contartde_siegechateau2|I'm not going to get you killed with these odd soldier duties. However I have something that fits your passion. You could join the ranks who are about to storm the castle of the noble that the Duke blames for treason.
dlga_capit_camp_win_contartde_siegechateau2:capit_camp_win_contartde_siegechateau3|The felon Count de Penthiévre must not escape punishment. The Duke put a price on his head and besieged the keep where the Count retreated with his family. We are responsible for tending the siege. When the bulk of the army arrives, the Duke will give a word to begin the assault. It seems that there's a huge bounty for the Count's head, but we only need to hold the siege and prevent any of his subjects from getting out. Is that understood?
dlga_capit_camp_win_contartde_siegechateau3:capit_camp_win_contartde_siegechateau4|I will hold the siege, captain.
dlga_capit_camp_win_contartde_siegechateau3:close_window|I have to leave for now, captain. I will come by and see later if there are contracts.
dlga_capit_camp_win_contartde_siegechateau4:close_window|Very well, in that case join the siege of Quintin. Come back when the Duke's troops relieve you. Don't try anything stupid.

dlga_capit_camp_win_crennesintrorecrut2retour:capit_camp_win_crennesintro|Do you need anything else?
dlga_capit_camp_win_crennesintro:close_window|I must go.
dlga_start:capit_camp_fail_crennes|Have you completed the contract for the Count of Rennes?
dlga_capit_camp_fail_crennes:capit_camp_fail_crennes2|I weren't able to honor the contract, master. The crowd overwhelmed me.
dlga_capit_camp_fail_crennes2:capit_camp_fail_crennessuit|That's annoying, very annoying.
dlga_capit_camp_fail_crennessuit:capit_camp_fail_lance_contrat|Do you have another contract for me, captain? I know without fail that I can rebuild my reputation!
dlga_capit_camp_fail_lance_contrat:capit_camp_fail_lance_contrat2|Really?... Well maybe you could join the ranks of soldiers, who are about to storm the castle of a noble the Duke considers responsible for treason.

dlga_capit_camp_cran_caravanwin:capit_camp_cran_caravanwin2|They are dead captain, not one of them survived.
dlga_capit_camp_cran_caravanwin2:capit_camp_cran_caravanwinintro|Excellent, here's your reward for the work.
dlga_capit_camp_cran_caravanwinintro:capit_camp_cran_caravanquetsuit|Do you have another contract for me?
dlga_capit_camp_cran_caravanquetsuit:capit_camp_cran_caravanquetsuit2|You have proven your worth by completing your last mission and coming back alive. I do have something for you. It involves guarding the entrance to a mansion of a noble Breton, who has been receiving death threats. You are to prevent the man from being killed. Use whatever means necessary.
dlga_capit_camp_cran_caravanquetsuit2:capit_camp_cran_caravanquetsuit2ok|I never refuse an opportunity, captain. I'll do it.

dlga_capit_camp_cran_fer_emploie:capit_camp_cran_fer_emploie2|Indeed, we are always in search of soldiers ready to fight for gold or whatever they want, as long as the orders are followed. I have an assignment which should allow you to prove yourself.
dlga_capit_camp_cran_fer_emploie2:capit_camp_cran_fer_emploie3|Usually our contracts don't involve chasing bandits, but this noble Breton wants to teach them a lesson and get his stolen merchandise back. You will be paid upon completion, of course.

dlga_camp_cran_fer_hello:close_window.1|...
dlga_start:camp_cran_fer_ducrec|I heard that the Duke of Brittany is looking for volunteers for a dangerous mission, but he didn't want our guys. What's that supposed to mean?

dlga_camp_cran_travv2:close_window|The captain's tent is at the end of the camp.
dlga_start:camp_cran_fer_entrr|What brings you here?
dlga_camp_cran_fer_entrr:camp_cran_travv|I would like to recruit mercenaries from your company. I can pay.

dlga_start:camp_cran_fer_chevaux|Beautiful horses.
dlga_camp_cran_fer_chevaux:camp_cran_fer_chevaux2|Can I buy one?
dlga_camp_cran_fer_chevaux2:close_window|Of course not. The company moves on foot. These horses are for the captain and he does not sell them. They are gifts from the Duke.
dlga_start:camp_cran_fer_patrouille|I’m on duty, no time to speak.
dlga_camp_cran_fer_patrouille:close_window|Enjoy your patrol, my friend.
dlga_start:camp_cran_fer_lapin|Not bad, eh? I pulled these two rabbits myself. I considered sharing them... but ultimately decided against it.
dlga_camp_cran_fer_lapin:close_window|I'd better leave you to your rabbits.
dlga_start:camp_cran_fer_evie|There's nothing quite like a nice dinner to celebrate the fact that we are still alive, right?
dlga_camp_cran_fer_evie:camp_cran_fer_evie2|This is a game for you?
dlga_camp_cran_fer_evie:close_window|Maybe.
dlga_camp_cran_fer_evie2:close_window|Of course you have to earn a living, but why not make yourself as comfortable as possible? I prefer to see the glass half full rather than half empty, although full glass would be even better.
dlga_start:camp_cran_fer_jeu1|How about a game of dice, friend?
dlga_camp_cran_fer_jeu1:camp_cran_fer_jeuok|Sure...
dlga_camp_cran_fer_jeu1:close_window|I'd like to be able to lay low like you, but sadly that's not possible.
dlga_camp_cran_fer_jeuok:generique_des|Finally someone to take to the cleaners.
dlga_start:camp_cran_fer_coffre|Don't touch the chests, is that understood?
dlga_camp_cran_fer_coffre:camp_cran_fer_coffre2|Do I look like a thief?
dlga_camp_cran_fer_coffre2:close_window|Yes.
dlga_start:camp_cran_perm|Where are you going? This is the captain's tent.
dlga_camp_cran_perm:camp_cran_perm2|I want to see the captain.
dlga_camp_cran_perm:close_window|I'm afraid I got lost.
dlga_camp_cran_perm2:camp_cran_perm3|What for?
dlga_camp_cran_perm3:camp_cran_permok|I would like to recruit mercenaries from your company. I can pay.
dlga_camp_cran_perm3:camp_cran_permok.1|I'm looking to join your ranks, I know how to fight.
dlga_camp_cran_permok:close_window|Permission granted.
dlga_lord_start:lord_generic_mission_completed|Your surgeon managed to convince my friend and made the operation.  The matter is in God's hands now, , and all we can do is pray for his recovery. Anyway, I thank you for lending your surgeon to me {sir/madam}. You have a noble spirit. I will not forget it.
dlga_lord_start:wedding_ceremony_bride_vow|May the heavens witness that I am ready to give you my {s11} {s4}, to have in marriage...
dlga_lord_start:lord_wedding_reschedule|It is good to see you, {playername}. We look forward to the wedding, as soon as we can all gather together for the feast.{s12}
dlga_lord_wedding_reschedule:lord_start|It is no problem. I can wait.
dlga_lord_wedding_reschedule:lord_return_dower|I have no faith that this wedding will be concluded. Please return my dower.
dlga_lord_return_dower:close_window|Well, that is your right, if you indeed have no confidence in our family's commitments. Take your money.
dlga_lord_start:lord_generic_mission_completed.1|Hah! Our little plot against {s3} worked perfectly, {playername}. The fool has lost one of his most valuable retainers, and we are one step closer to bringing him to his knees. Here, this purse contains {reg5} crowns, and I wish you to have it. You deserve every copper. And, need I remind you, there could be much more to come if you've a mind to earn it...
dlga_lord_start:close_window|You weren't able to complete a simple task. I had set up everything. The only thing you needed to do was sacrifice a messenger, and we would be celebrating now. But no, you were too damned honorable, weren't you?
dlga_lord_start:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_completed|Have you brought me any news about that task I gave you? You know the one I mean...
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_completed:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_completed_2|I have the reports you wanted right here.
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_completed_2:lord_pretalk|Ahh, well done. It's good to have competent {men/people} on my side. Here is the payment I promised you.
dlga_lord_start:lord_pretalk|Brilliant work, {playername}! Whatever you did, the nobles of the {s13} are clamoring for war! Soon, the time will come for us to reap the benefits of our hard work, from fields ripe for plunder. This war is going to make us rich, mark my words!
dlga_lord_start:lord_collect_debt_completed|I'm told that you've collected the money owed me from {s7}. Good, it's past time I had it back. I believe I promised to give you one-fifth of it all, eh? Well, that makes {reg3} crowns, so if you give me my share -- that's {reg4} crowns -- you can keep the rest.
dlga_lord_collect_debt_completed:lord_collect_debt_pay|Of course, {s65}. {reg4} crowns, all here.
dlga_lord_collect_debt_pay:lord_pretalk|I must admit I'm impressed, {playername}. I had lost hope of ever getting this money back. Please accept my sincere thanks.
dlga_lord_collect_debt_completed:lord_collect_debt_no_pay|I am afraid I don't have the money with me sir.
dlga_lord_collect_debt_no_pay:close_window|Is this a joke? I know full well that {s7} gave you the money, and I want every denar owed to me, {sir/madam}. As far as I'm concerned, I hold you personally in my debt until I see that silver.
dlga_lord_start:close_window.1|I heard you got rid of that poxy merchant that was causing me so much grief. I can see you're not afraid to get your hands dirty, eh? I like that in a {man/woman}. Here's your reward. Remember, {playername}, stick with me and we'll go a long, long way together.
dlga_lord_start:close_window.2|Oh, it's you. Enlighten me, how exactly does one lose a simple fight to some poxy, lowborn merchant? Truly, if I ever need my guardsmen to take a lesson in how to lay down and die, I'll be sure to come to you. Just leave me be, {playername}, I have things to do.
dlga_lord_start:lord_kill_local_merchant_let_go|You! Do you have sawdust between your ears? Did you think that when I said to kill the merchant, I meant you to have a nice chat with him and then let him go?! What possessed you?
dlga_lord_kill_local_merchant_let_go:lord_kill_local_merchant_let_go_2|Sir, I made sure he will not act against you.
dlga_lord_kill_local_merchant_let_go_2:lord_pretalk|Piffle. You were supposed to remove him, not give him a sermon and send him on his way. He had better do as you say, or you'll both regret it. Here, this is half the money I promised you. Don't say a word, {playername}, you're lucky to get even that. I have little use for {men/people} who cannot follow orders.
dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_completed|Beautiful work, {playername}! You captured both the spy and his handler, just as I'd hoped, and the pair are now safely ensconced in my dungeon, waiting to be questioned. My torturer shall be busy tonight! Anyway, I'm very pleased with your success, {playername}, and I give you this purse as a token of my appreciation.
dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_half_completed|Blast and damn you! I wanted TWO prisoners, {playername} -- what you've brought me is one step short of useless! I already know everything the spy knows, it was the handler I was after. Here, half a job gets you half a reward. Take it and begone.
dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_half_completed.1|I asked you for two prisoners, {playername}, not one. Two. Still, I suppose you did capture the spy's handler, the more important one of the pair. The spy will not dare return here and will prove quite useless to whatever master he served. 'Tis better than nothing. However, you'll understand if I pay you half the promised reward for what is but half a success.
dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_failed|Truly, {playername}, you are nothing short of totally incompetent. Failing to capture both the spy AND his handler plumbs astonishing new depths of failure. Forget any reward I offered you. You've done nothing to earn it.
dlga_lord_follow_spy_half_completed:lord_pretalk|I did my best, {s65}.
dlga_lord_follow_spy_completed:lord_pretalk|Thank you, {s65}.
dlga_lord_follow_spy_failed:lord_pretalk|Hrm. As you like, {s65}.
dlga_lord_start:lord_generic_mission_completed.2|Splendid work, {playername}. All the serfs are back, properly cowed, and they're busy preparing for the harvest. You certainly earned your reward. Here, take it, with my compliments.
dlga_lord_start:lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed|{playername}. I have been waiting patiently for my serfs, yet none have returned. Have you an explanation? Were you outwitted by simple field hands, or are you merely incompetent? Or perhaps you are plotting with my enemies, intending to ruin me...
dlga_lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed:lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed_1a|Forgive me, {s65}, those serfs were slippery as eels.
dlga_lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed:lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed_1b|Perhaps if you had treated them better...
dlga_lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed_1a:lord_pretalk|Hmph, that is hardly an excuse for failure, {playername}. Now if you will excuse me, I need to recruit new men to work these fields before we all starve.
dlga_lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed_1b:close_window|Hah, now you reveal your true colours, traitor! Your words match your actions all too well. I should never have trusted you.
dlga_lord_start:lord_runaway_serf_half_completed|You disappoint me, {playername}. There were 3 groups of serfs that I charged you to return. 3. Not {reg17}. I suppose the ones who did come back shall have to work twice as hard to make up for those that got away. As for your reward, {playername}, I'll only pay you for the serfs you returned, not the ones you let fly. Here. Take it, and let this business be done.
dlga_lord_runaway_serf_half_completed:lord_pretalk|Thank you, {s65}. You are indeed generous.
dlga_lord_runaway_serf_half_completed:lord_pretalk.1|Bah, this proved to be a waste of my time.
dlga_lord_start:lord_deal_with_bandits_completed|{playername}, I was told that you have crushed the bandits at my village of {s5}. Please know that I am most grateful to you for that. Please, let me pay the expenses of your campaign. Here, I hope these {reg14} crowns will be adequate.
dlga_lord_deal_with_bandits_completed:lord_pretalk|Not a problem, {s65}.
dlga_lord_deal_with_bandits_completed:lord_pretalk.1|Glad to be of service.
dlga_lord_deal_with_bandits_completed:lord_pretalk.2|It was mere child's play.
dlga_lord_start:lord_pretalk.1|Damn it, {playername}. I heard that you were unable to drive off the bandits from my village of {s5}, and thanks to you, my village now lies in ruins. Everyone said that you were a capable warrior, but apparently, they were wrong.
dlga_lord_start:lord_deliver_cattle_to_army_thank|Ah, {playername}. My quartermaster has informed me of your delivery, {reg13} heads of cattle, as I requested. I'm impressed.
dlga_lord_deliver_cattle_to_army_thank:lord_pretalk|Not a problem, {s65}.
dlga_lord_deliver_cattle_to_army_thank:lord_pretalk.1|Glad to be of service.
dlga_lord_deliver_cattle_to_army_thank:lord_pretalk.2|Mere child's play.
dlga_lord_start:lord_scout_waypoints_thank|You make a good scout, {playername}. My runner just brought me your reports of your scouting mission. Well done.
dlga_lord_scout_waypoints_thank:lord_pretalk|A simple task, {s65}.
dlga_lord_scout_waypoints_thank:lord_pretalk.1|Nothing I couldn't handle.
dlga_lord_scout_waypoints_thank:lord_pretalk.2|My pleasure, {s65}.
dlga_lord_freelancer_deserters_thank:lord_pretalk|Cowardice is never an excuse for treason.
dlga_lord_freelancer_deserters_thank:lord_pretalk.1|It was a difficult task, but it had to be done.
dlga_lord_freelancer_deserters_fail:lord_pretalk|I will do better next time.
dlga_lord_start:lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army|The army's supplies are dwindling too quickly, {playername}. I need you to bring me {reg3} heads of cattle so I can keep the troops fed. I care very little about where you get them, just bring them to me as soon as you can.
dlga_lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army:lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army_accepted|Very well, I can find you some cattle.
dlga_lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army:lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army_rejected|Sorry, sir, I have other plans.
dlga_lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army_accepted:close_window|Excellent! You know what to do, {playername}, now get to it. I need that cattle sooner rather than later.
dlga_lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army_rejected:close_window|That . . . is unfortunate, {playername}. I shall have to find someone else who's up to the task. Please go now, I've work to do.
dlga_lord_start:lord_pretalk.2|Thank you for answering the summons, {playername}. However, as we are now at peace, we do not need your services. You may attend to your other business.
dlga_lord_start:lord_report_to_army_asked|Ah, you have arrived at last, {playername}. We've been expecting you. I hope you have brought with you troops of sufficient number and experience.
dlga_lord_report_to_army_asked:lord_report_to_army_completed|I have a company of good, hardened soldiers with me. We are ready to join you.
dlga_lord_report_to_army_asked:lord_report_to_army_continue|I don't have the sufficient number of troops yet. I will need some more time.
dlga_lord_report_to_army_completed:close_window|Excellent. We'll be moving soon. Now -- you are a {man/warrior} of sound judgement, and we trust that you will do what is necessary to support our campaign. I do not require you to remain close at hand, and I will not count it against you if you believe that your forces would be of better use elsewhere. But if you do choose to remain with me, to support me in battle, that would be appreciated. I may also have additional tasks for you to perform.
dlga_lord_report_to_army_continue:close_window|Then you'd better hurry. We'll be moving out soon against the enemy and I need every able hand we can muster.
dlga_lord_start:lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints|{playername}, I need a volunteer to scout the area. We're sorely lacking on information, and I simply must have a better picture of the situation before we can proceed. I want you to go to {s13}, {s14} and {s15} and report back whatever you find.
dlga_lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints:lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints_accepted|You've found your volunteer, sir.
dlga_lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints:lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints_rejected|I fear I must decline.
dlga_lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints_accepted:close_window|Good {man/lass}! Simply pass near {s13}, {s14} and {s15} and check out what's there. Make a note of anything you find and return to me as soon as possible.
dlga_lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints_rejected:lord_pretalk|Hm. I'm disappointed, {playername}. Very disappointed. We'll talk later, I need to go and find somebody to scout for us.
dlga_lord_generic_mission_thank:lord_generic_mission_completed|You have been most helpful, {playername}. My thanks.
dlga_lord_generic_mission_completed:lord_pretalk|It was an honour to serve.
dlga_lord_start:lord_pay_debt_2|I think you owe me {reg1} crowns, {playername}. Do you intend to pay your debt anytime soon?
dlga_lord_pay_debt_2:lord_pay_debt_3_1|That is why I came, {s65}. Here it is, every denar I owe you.
dlga_lord_pay_debt_2:lord_pay_debt_3_2|Alas, I don't have sufficient funds, {s65}. But I'll pay you soon enough.
dlga_lord_pay_debt_3_1:lord_pretalk|Ah, excellent. You are a {man/woman} of honour, {playername}. I am satisfied. Your debt to me has been paid in full.
dlga_lord_pay_debt_3_2:lord_pretalk|Well, don't keep me waiting much longer.
dlga_lord_start:lord_start.1|By the way, I hope you get a chance to meet my {s11}, {s14}.  
dlga_lord_start:lord_start.2|By the way, I am sure that my {s11}, {s14}, would be delighted were you to pay her a visit. She awaits you in her chambers.
dlga_lord_start:lord_buy_prisoner|I heard that you have captured our enemy {s3} and he is with you at the moment. I can pay you {reg6} crowns for him if you want to get rid of him. You can wait for his family to pay his ransom of course, but there is no telling how long that will take, eh?
dlga_lord_buy_prisoner:lord_buy_prisoner_accept|I accept your offer. I'll leave {s3} to you for {reg6} crowns.
dlga_lord_buy_prisoner:lord_buy_prisoner_deny|I fear I can't accept your offer.
dlga_lord_buy_prisoner_accept:lord_pretalk|Excellent! Here's your {reg6} crowns. I'll send some men to take him to our prison with due haste.
dlga_lord_buy_prisoner_deny:lord_pretalk|Mmm. As you wish, {playername}, but you'll not get a better offer. Take it from me.
dlga_lord_start:lord_talk|I lift a {s5} to your health, {playername}! You are most gracious to host us on this occasion. Now, what is it?
dlga_lord_start:lord_talk.1|To your health, {sire/your Highness}. Long may you reign. What is your bidding?
dlga_lord_start:lord_talk.2|What is your bidding?
dlga_lord_start:lord_talk.3|I wish to welcome you to my hall on this auspicious occasion. Now, what is it?
dlga_lord_start:lord_talk.4|Let us lift a {s5} to the health of our host, {s4}. Now, what is it?
dlga_lord_talk:offer_gift_quest_complete|I have the materials for {s4}'s gift.
dlga_offer_gift_quest_complete:close_window|Ah, let me take those. Hopefully this will mend the quarrel between you two. You may wish to speak to {reg4?her:him}, and see if I had any success.
dlga_lord_talk:intrigue_quest_state_complaint|My lord -- there is something I wish to tell you in confidence, about one of your vassals.
dlga_intrigue_quest_state_complaint:lord_pretalk|Whatever you have to say, I would ask you to wait until we are alone.
dlga_intrigue_quest_state_complaint:intrigue_quest_state_complaint_plyr|What is it? I value your opinion, although I hope that you are not trying to sew dissension among my vassals? 
dlga_intrigue_quest_state_complaint_plyr:lord_intrigue_quest_complaint_stated|My liege -- {s4} is widely held by your vassals to be {s5}, and a liability to your realm
dlga_intrigue_quest_state_complaint_plyr:lord_pretalk|Actually, my liege, never mind.
dlga_lord_intrigue_quest_complaint_stated:lord_pretalk|Hmm... This is troubling to hear. Although I do not encourage my vassals to speak ill of each other, I value your opinion. Perhaps I should think twice about granting {s4} any further fiefs or offices...
dlga_lord_intrigue_quest_complaint_stated:intrigue_quest_state_complaint_failed|Sew discord among my vassals, will you? With everything else going on, do you think I appreciate my nobles turning on each other like quarreling dogs? Let me ask you this -- did someone put you up this?
dlga_intrigue_quest_state_complaint_failed:intrigue_quest_state_accept_blame|I stand by my words, my liege.
dlga_intrigue_quest_state_complaint_failed:intrigue_quest_state_deflect_blame|Yes, sire -- {s4} put me up to denouncing {s5}!
dlga_intrigue_quest_state_accept_blame:lord_pretalk|Indeed. You may stand by your words, but keep them to yourself. I will not have you undercutting my faithful follower {s4}.
dlga_intrigue_quest_state_deflect_blame:lord_pretalk|I thought as much. Here's some advice for you, {lad/lassie} -- don't meddle in the quarrels of others. Now, enough of this.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_denounce_1|I want to tell you something -- we have had enough of your {s4} ways
dlga_lord_denounce_1:lord_denounce_2|I'm sorry... What did you say?
dlga_lord_denounce_2:lord_denounce_3|You heard me. You will {s4}
dlga_lord_denounce_2:lord_pretalk|Never mind. You must have misheard me.
dlga_lord_denounce_3:close_window|Why would you say such a thing? To insult me like this, in spite of our friendship -- how much more cruel is a knife in my back from an erstwhile friends, than the sword of a sworn foe. I do not know what game you are playing, but I want no part of it. Go away. I do not want to look at you.
dlga_lord_denounce_3:close_window.1|Hmph. Really? Is that your opinion, or did one of my rivals put those words in your mouth? Never mind. I will not play your game. Go away, and take your intrigues with you.
dlga_lord_denounce_3:lord_denounce_4|I will not have you shame me in public, {sir/my lady}. Retract your words, or meet me on the duelling ground.
dlga_lord_denounce_3:lord_denounce_4.1|Is that so? Well, hear this -- you're a snake, and a knave, and -- if you don't meet me on the duelling ground -- a coward. What say you to that? Do you retract your words, or shall we cross swords?
dlga_lord_denounce_4:lord_respond_to_insult_challenge_duel_confirm|It would be a pleasure to fight you.
dlga_lord_denounce_4:lord_denounce_retract|I spoke rashly. I retract my words.
dlga_lord_denounce_retract:lord_pretalk|I thought as much. Now, be gone from here.

dlga_lord_talk:lord_husband_auto_recruit|I need you to renounce your allegiance to {s4} and join the {s5} now, my husband.
dlga_lord_husband_auto_recruit:lord_pretalk|Ask me again when we are outside of these walls, my wife.

dlga_lord_respond_to_insult:lord_pretalk.1|I meant no offense, madame.
dlga_lord_respond_to_insult:lord_respond_to_insult_challenge_battle|Are you trying to provoke me? Well, I would have you know that I am under no obligation to duel women, commoners, rebels, or brigands. I could, however, order my men to seize you and horsewhip you. Would you like them to do that?

Well, I would have you know that I am under no obligation to duel women, commoners, rebels, or brigands. However, in your case, I would be delighted to make an exception.

dlga_lord_respond_to_insult:close_window|Are you trying to provoke me? Well, I would have you know that I am under no obligation to duel women, commoners, rebels, or brigands.

dlga_lord_quarrel_intervention_2:lord_quarrel_intervention_3b.1|Could you not be convinced to settle your differences?
dlga_lord_quarrel_intervention_2:lord_pretalk|On second thought, I want nothing to do with this.
dlga_lord_quarrel_intervention_3a:lord_pretalk|I'm glad that you think so.
dlga_lord_quarrel_intervention_3b:lord_quarrel_intervention_4|For the sake of our friendship, I defer to your judgment. I will try to make amends with {s11}.
dlga_lord_quarrel_intervention_3b:lord_pretalk|I will not reconcile with {s11}. I know my rights.
dlga_lord_quarrel_intervention_4:lord_pretalk|Let it be as though our quarrel never occurred.
dlga_lord_quarrel_intervention_4:lord_pretalk.1|I suppose that you should speak to {s11}, and see if he will do the same for me.

dlga_lord_internal_politics_support_same_acknowledge:lord_pretalk.2|I will tell {s4}. He will no doubt be grateful for your support.
dlga_lord_internal_politics_plyr_choose_candidate_select:lord_internal_politics_pretalk.2|I support {s4}
dlga_lord_internal_politics_pretalk:lord_internal_politics_cur_stance_plyr_response|Ah. Most interesting.
dlga_lord_internal_politics_cur_stance_plyr_response:lord_internal_politics_plyr_request_support|Can I convince you to support me instead?
dlga_lord_internal_politics_cur_stance_plyr_response:lord_pretalk|Anyway, enough of politics for the time being.
dlga_lord_internal_politics_plyr_request_support:lord_pretalk|You have engendered too much controversy to be a viable candidate right now. I would advise you to wait a little while before seeking any further honors for yourself.
dlga_lord_internal_politics_plyr_request_support:lord_pretalk.1|I am sorry. I would not wish to strain my relationship with {s4}
dlga_lord_internal_politics_plyr_request_support:lord_pretalk.2|You have already been well-rewarded with fiefs appropriate to your accomplishments, I would say.
dlga_lord_internal_politics_plyr_request_support:lord_pretalk.3|I think you would need to prove yourself further before you are eligible for that position.
dlga_lord_internal_politics_plyr_request_support:lord_pretalk.4|Hmm... That is too much to ask, given the state of our relationship. 
dlga_lord_internal_politics_plyr_request_support:lord_pretalk.5|I would support you with pleasure.

dlga_lord_spouse_leave_faction_husband_king:lord_pretalk.1|Perhaps, but I would need your full support to press that claim. You would want to resolve {s4}'s rebellion before pushing this any further.
dlga_lord_spouse_leave_faction_husband_king:lord_spouse_leave_faction_husband_king_2|Most of the great families of this land have a claim to the throne... Given the recent issues with the succession, I should be as legitimate a king as {s4}.

dlga_lord_ask_to_make_peace_2:convince_begin|Perhaps I can talk you into it...
dlga_lord_ask_to_make_peace_2:lord_pretalk|Never mind, peace can wait for now.
dlga_convince_accept:close_window.1|You... have convinced me, {playername}. Very well then, you've my blessing to bring a peace offer to {s14}. I cannot guarantee they will accept it, but on the off-chance they do, I will stand by it.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_challenge_duel_for_lady|I want you to take back your accusations against {s1}.
dlga_lord_challenge_duel_for_lady:lord_challenge_duel_for_lady_2|What accusations? Everyone knows that she beds her stable boys and anyone else she can lay hands on while her husband is away. I merely repeat the words of many.
dlga_lord_challenge_duel_for_lady_2:lord_challenge_duel|You will recant these lies, sirrah, or prove them against my sword!
dlga_lord_challenge_duel_for_lady_2:lord_pretalk|If you say so...
dlga_lord_challenge_duel:close_window|{s15}
dlga_lord_talk:lord_challenge_courtship_rival|Relinquish your suit of {s5}!
dlga_lord_challenge_courtship_rival:lord_challenge_courtship_rival_2|Or what? Do you intend to duel over a lady? I'll let you know -- our liege frowns on this sort of hot-headed challenge, when every man must stand together against the foreign foe.
dlga_lord_challenge_courtship_rival_2:lord_challenge_duel|Do you fear to fight me?
dlga_lord_challenge_courtship_rival_2:lord_pretalk|My pardon. I have spoken rashly...
dlga_lord_talk:lord_message_delivered|I bring a message from {s9}.
dlga_lord_message_delivered:lord_pretalk|Oh? Let me see that... Well, well, well! It was good of you to bring me this, {playername}. Take my seal as proof that I've received it, and give my regards to {s9} when you see him again.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_message_delivered_enemy|I bring a message from {s9}.
dlga_lord_message_delivered_enemy:close_window|Oh? Let me see that... Hmm. It was good of you to bring me this, {playername}. Take my seal as proof that I've received it, with my thanks.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_deliver_message_prisoner|I bring a message from {s11}.
dlga_lord_deliver_message_prisoner:lord_deliver_message_prisoner_2|Can it be true? Oh, thank you kindly, {playername}! You have brought hope and some small ray of light to these bleak walls. Perhaps one day I will be able to repay you.
dlga_lord_deliver_message_prisoner_2:lord_deliver_message_prisoner_2a|'Twas the least I could do, {s65}.
dlga_lord_deliver_message_prisoner_2a:close_window|You've no idea how grateful I am, {playername}. A thousand thanks and more.
dlga_lord_deliver_message_prisoner_2:lord_deliver_message_prisoner_2b|Worry not, {s65}. You'll have ample opportunity once you are free again.
dlga_lord_deliver_message_prisoner_2b:close_window|Hah, of course, {playername}. My eternal thanks go with you.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_rescue_by_replace_offer|Fear not, I am here to rescue you.
dlga_lord_rescue_by_replace_offer:lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_2|By God, are you serious? What is your plan?
dlga_lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_2:lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_3|A simple ruse, {s65}. If we exchange garments, I shall take your place here in prison, while you make your escape disguised as myself. I paid the guards a handsome bribe, with which I am sure they have already purchased half the wine stocks of the nearest tavern. With some luck they'll soon get so drunk they'd have trouble recognising their own mothers, let alone telling one of us from the other. At least not until you are safely away.
dlga_lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_3:lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_4|Hmm, it might just work... But what of you, my {friend/lady}? The guards won't take kindly to this trickery. You may end up spending some time in this cell yourself.
dlga_lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_4:lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_5a|Not to worry, {s65}. The place is already starting to grow on me.
dlga_lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_4:lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_5b|I shall be fine as long there is an ample reward waiting at the end.
dlga_lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_5a:lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_6|You are a brave soul indeed. I won't forget this.
dlga_lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_5b:lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_6|Of course, my {friend/lady}, of course! Come to me when you have regained your freedom, and perhaps I shall be able to repay the debt I owe you.
dlga_lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_6:close_window|Quickly, {s65}, let us change garments. It is past time you were away from here.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_ask_pardon_after_oath_renounced|{s66}, I wish to restore my old oath to {s4}.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_after_oath_renounced:lord_pretalk|That is too great a matter for me to decide, {playername}. You should seek out {s4}. Such clemency is his alone to grant or deny.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_after_oath_renounced:lord_ask_pardon_terms|{s11}.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_terms:lord_pretalk|As you like, {s65}. I will accept your judgment.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_terms:lord_pretalk.1|A shame, {s65}. A shame.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_terms:lord_pretalk.2|Very well, go and die without me.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_terms:lord_ask_pardon_after_renounce_peace|Aye, I am ready.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_terms:lord_ask_pardon_terms_rejected|On second thought, no. I don't wish to be in your service again.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_terms:lord_ask_pardon_after_renounce_peace.1|Aye, I agree to those terms.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_terms:lord_ask_pardon_terms_rejected.1|That is too high a price, {s65}. I must decline.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_after_renounce_peace:lord_pretalk|Excellent. Though you strayed from us, {playername}, it gladdens all our hearts that you have found your way back to the right path. I hereby restore your homage to me. Rise once more as an honoured {man/warrior} in my service.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_terms_rejected:close_window|Then get out of my sight, traitor! Begone with you, and do not come back!
dlga_lord_talk:lord_ask_pardon|I wish to make peace with the {s4}.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon:lord_pretalk|Do you indeed, {playername}? Then go and trip on your sword. Give us all peace.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon:lord_pretalk.1|{playername}, you are a {lord/lady} without a master, holding lands in your name, with only the barest scrap of a claim to legitimacy. No king in France would accept a lasting peace with you.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon:lord_pretalk.2|Make peace when I have you at an advantage? I think not.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon:lord_pretalk.3|I do not see it as being in my current interest to make peace.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon:lord_truce_offer|Yes... I am weary of fighting you. I could offer you a truce of forty days. If you keep your word and do not molest my lands and subjects, we may talk again...
dlga_lord_truce_offer:close_window|I accept. Let us stop making war upon each other, for the time being anyway
dlga_lord_truce_offer:lord_pretalk|On second thought, such an accord would not be in my interests.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon:lord_ask_pardon_2|Hmm. I could use my considerable influence to arrange a pardon for you, {playername}, but there are some who see you as an enemy and will not be satisfied unless you pay tribute. All in all, you'd need to bring no less than {reg16} crowns to make any friends in {s4}.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon:lord_pretalk.4|I am in no position to offer you anything. You must speak to {s7}.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon:lord_ask_pardon_2.1|Yes... I have bigger worries than you or your followers. However, you have wronged my subjects, and wrongs demand compensation. For the sume of {reg16} crowns, I suppose that I could agree to grant you a pardon. What do you say?
dlga_lord_ask_pardon:lord_pretalk.5|I am sorry. I am in no position to offer you a pardon
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_2:lord_ask_pardon_tribue_accept|I have the money here. {reg16} crowns.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_2:lord_ask_pardon_tribue_deny|I fear I cannot pay that much.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_tribue_accept:close_window|Excellent, {playername}. I will use this to make amends to those you have wronged, and I will let it be known that you are no longer an enemy of the {s4}.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_tribue_accept:close_window.1|Excellent, {playername}. I'll use the coin to smooth the feathers of those that can oppose your pardon, and I'm sure that word will soon spread that you are no longer an enemy of {s4}.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_tribue_deny:lord_pretalk|Then there's nothing I can do for you, {playername}. No silver, no pardon.
dlga_lord_talk:diplo_roy_start|My lord, may I submit my humble opinion about matters concerning the Kingdom?
dlga_diplo_roy_start:diplo_roy_startwin|Well... why not. I'm listening, what is it?
dlga_diplo_roy_start:diplo_roy_startfail|Who do you think you are, {playername}? Be sure to stay in your place, that of a fighter, not a counselor. I have plenty of felons to surround me. I may have misjudged with you. So you're like the others... unfortunate.
dlga_diplo_roy_startfail:lord_pretalk|Nothing, sorry to have bothered you with this.
dlga_diplo_roy_startwin:diplo_roy_startwinbrg|About Burgundy.
dlga_diplo_roy_startwin:diplo_roy_startwinang|About the Englishmen.
dlga_diplo_roy_startwin:lord_pretalk|Nothing, sorry to have bothered you with this.
dlga_diplo_roy_startwinbrg:diplo_roy_startwinbrg3|We should break the truce and attack the Burgundians. Without their allies the Englishmen have no chance. Of course my lord, I'm ready to support you with my men.
dlga_diplo_roy_startwinbrg:diplo_roy_startwin|Excuse me my lord, but I have to reconsider this issue.
dlga_diplo_roy_startwinbrg3:win_dialroi_guerre|Break the truce, you say? Are you not only driven by your personal ambitions?
dlga_win_dialroi_guerre:win_dialroi_guerre2|My lord, of course not, I try to work for the good of the Kingdom.
dlga_win_dialroi_guerre2:lord_pretalk|You're the first to suggest me that, and I could definitely benefit. But we have to hit hard and it'll have be disciplined, am I clear? The trumpets of Judgment will soon be heard. I suggest you obtain a blessing to the poor buggers who serve in your army by then.
dlga_diplo_roy_startwinang:diplo_roy_startwinang3|We need to break the truce and attack them before they gather, my lord. I'm ready to support you with my men.
dlga_diplo_roy_startwinang:diplo_roy_startwin|Excuse me my lord, but I have to reconsider this issue.
dlga_diplo_roy_startwinang3:lord_pretalk|Break the truce, you say? You are not the first one to tell me that. We could definitely benefit. But we will have to hit hard and it has to be a disciplined effort, am I clear? Be ready when the time comes, or you will regret your words, believe me.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_active_mission_1|About the task you gave me...
dlga_lord_talk:lord_switch_to_spouse|Let us discuss matters related to our household.
dlga_lord_switch_to_spouse:lord_pretalk|Let us wait until we are in a hall, my wife, as it is difficult to deal with household inventories and such matters in the field.
dlga_lord_switch_to_spouse:spouse_talk|Certainly, my wife.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_request_mission_ask|Do you have any tasks for me?
dlga_lord_talk:combined_political_quests|Do you think we can work together to advance our standings in this realm?
dlga_combined_political_quests:lord_pretalk|I do not imagine that you and I have many mutual interests.
dlga_combined_political_quests:lord_pretalk.1|Hmm.. Perhaps we can discuss this matter in a more private setting, at a later date.
dlga_combined_political_quests:lord_pretalk.2|Hmm.. I do have an idea, but it would require you that you be free of controversy. If you were to wait some time without getting into any arguments with the other lords of our realm, perhaps we could proceed further.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_ask_resign_marshalship|I wish to resign the marshalship.
dlga_lord_ask_resign_marshalship:lord_pretalk|So be it. I shall have to find someone else.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_ask_enter_service|{s66}, I have come to offer you my sword in vassalage!
dlga_lord_talk:lord_ask_enter_service.1|{s66}, I wish to become your sworn {man/woman} and fight for your honour.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_ask_leave_service|{s66}, I wish to be released from my oath to you.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_talk_preoffer|I have an offer for you.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_give_troops|I want to give some troops to you.
dlga_lord_give_troops:lord_pretalk|Well, I could use some good soldiers. Thank you.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_give_order_ask|I have a new task for you.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_give_suggestion_ask|May I suggest a course of action?
dlga_lord_give_order_ask:lord_give_order|Yes?
dlga_lord_give_suggestion_ask:lord_give_order|I will gladly follow your direction, {sire/your Highness}. If you intend to direct an extensive campaign, however, you may also wish to declare yourself marshal, so there is no cause for confusion.
dlga_lord_give_suggestion_ask:lord_pretalk|My apologies. I don't know you well enough to take your advice.
dlga_lord_give_suggestion_ask:lord_give_order.1|What is it?
dlga_lord_give_order:lord_give_order_answer|Follow me.
dlga_lord_give_order:lord_give_order_answer.1|Will you follow me? I have a plan...
dlga_lord_give_order:lord_give_order_details_ask|Go to...
dlga_lord_give_order:lord_give_order_details_ask.1|Raid around the village of...
dlga_lord_give_order:lord_give_order_details_ask.2|Patrol around...
dlga_lord_give_order:lord_give_order_assault|Together, you and I can take {s11}. You should assault immediately...
dlga_lord_give_order:lord_give_order_details_ask.3|We are under attack, but the enemy can be repulsed. You should ride towards...
dlga_lord_give_order:lord_give_order_details_ask.4|We are under attack, but the enemy can be repulsed. You should assemble the army and march to...
dlga_lord_give_order_assault:lord_pretalk|{s4} is directing this siege. I suggest you speak to {reg4?her:him}
dlga_lord_give_order_assault:lord_pretalk.1|Our preparations are not yet ready. We need another {s11}
dlga_lord_give_order_assault:close_window|Very well -- to the walls!
dlga_lord_give_order:lord_give_order_details_ask.5|There is a fortress which can easily be taken. Go to..
dlga_lord_give_order:lord_give_order_details_ask.6|The enemy is coming in force. Flee in the direction of...
dlga_lord_give_order:lord_give_order_stop|I won't need you for some time. You are free to do as you like.
dlga_lord_give_order:lord_give_order_stop.1|You no longer need to accompany me.
dlga_lord_give_order:lord_pretalk|Never mind.
dlga_lord_give_order_details_ask:lord_pretalk|It is not my way to turn tail and run, without even laying eyes on the enemy.
dlga_lord_give_order_details_ask:lord_pretalk.1|You want me to shed my blood outside a fortress while others stand by and watch? I think not.
dlga_lord_give_order_details_ask:lord_give_order_details|Where?
dlga_lord_give_order_details:lord_give_order_answer|{s1}
dlga_lord_give_order_details:lord_pretalk|Never mind.
dlga_lord_give_order_stop:lord_pretalk|All right. I will stop here.
dlga_lord_give_order_answer:lord_give_order|That would hardly be proper. It would be more appropriate for you to follow me instead. Did you have any other ideas?
dlga_lord_give_order_answer:lord_pretalk|All right. I will do that.{s12}
dlga_lord_give_order_answer:lord_pretalk.1|I am sorry. I need to attend my own business at the moment.
dlga_lord_start:lord_talk.5|What is it?
dlga_lord_talk:lord_give_order_call_to_arms_verify|I want to start a new campaign. Let us assemble the army here.
dlga_lord_give_order_call_to_arms_verify:lord_give_order_call_to_arms_verify_2|You wish to summon all lords for a new campaign?
dlga_lord_give_order_call_to_arms_verify_2:lord_give_order_call_to_arms|Yes. We must gather all our forces before we march on the enemy.
dlga_lord_give_order_call_to_arms_verify_2:lord_pretalk|On second thought, it won't be necessary to summon everyone.
dlga_lord_give_order_call_to_arms:lord_pretalk|All right then. I will send messengers and tell everyone to come here.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_give_order_disband_army_verify|I want to end the campaign and let everyone return home.
dlga_lord_give_order_disband_army_verify:lord_give_order_disband_army_2|You want to end the current campaign and release all lords from duty?
dlga_lord_give_order_disband_army_2:lord_give_order_disband_army|Yes. We no longer need all our forces here.
dlga_lord_give_order_disband_army_2:lord_pretalk|On second thought, it will be better to stay together for now.
dlga_lord_give_order_disband_army:lord_pretalk|All right. I will let everyone know that they are released from duty.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_talk_ask_something|I wish to ask you something.
dlga_lord_talk_ask_something:lord_talk_ask_something_2|Aye? What is it?
dlga_lord_talk_ask_something_again:lord_talk_ask_something_2|Is there anything else?
dlga_lord_talk_ask_something_2:lord_talk_ask_location|I want to know the location of someone.
dlga_lord_talk_ask_something_2:lord_tell_objective|What are you and your men doing?
dlga_lord_talk_ask_something_2:lord_talk_ask_about_strategy|What is the realm doing?
dlga_lord_talk_ask_about_strategy:lord_pretalk|You should decide that, as you are the marshal.
dlga_lord_talk_ask_something_2:lord_talk_ask_about_war|How goes the war?
dlga_lord_talk_ask_something_2:lord_marriage_permission|{s19}
dlga_lord_marriage_permission:lord_pretalk|Great heaven, man -- if I haven't given you permission to see her, do you think I'm going to give you permission to marry her?
dlga_lord_marriage_permission:lord_pretalk.1|It is not my way to push my {s11} to marry against her will or her better judgment.
dlga_lord_marriage_permission:lord_pretalk.2|Sorry, lad -- I'm not going to make my {s11} marry you, when I'd rather see her married to {s12}
dlga_lord_marriage_permission:lord_marriage_permission_endowment|Splendid news, my young man -- I shall be proud to have you in our family. Now, let us talk the terms of the marriage. As per our custom, the two of us must make sure that {s11} has sufficient finances to support herself, in the event of any unforeseen circumstances..
dlga_lord_marriage_permission_endowment:lord_marriage_permission_endowment_answer|I would say that, taking into consideration the prestige of our two houses, that you can provide a dower of {reg3} crowns, while I will supply a dowry of {reg4} crowns. This shall be her ladyship's property, as a security, lest for any reason you are unable to provide for her. What say you to that?
dlga_lord_marriage_permission_endowment_answer:lord_marriage_permission_engagement_date|Very well -- so let it be.
dlga_lord_marriage_permission_endowment_answer:lord_marriage_permission_endowment_answer_delay|I cannot afford that right now.
dlga_lord_marriage_permission_endowment_answer:lord_marriage_permission_endowment_answer_no|That is too much to pay.
dlga_lord_marriage_permission_endowment_answer_no:close_window|Well. I cannot in all decency allow my daughter to marry without some security, can I? Let me know if you change your mind.
dlga_lord_marriage_permission_engagement_date:close_window|Splendid! You two may now consider yourselves offically betrothed. Very well -- I shall plan to hold a great feast in {s24}, as soon as circumstances permit. We will be sure to notify you when the day comes.
dlga_lord_marriage_permission_engagement_date:close_window.1|Unfortunately, there is one final complication -- there is no safe place to hold the wedding. Let us hold off on finalizing this, for the time being.
dlga_lord_marriage_permission_endowment_answer_delay:lord_pretalk|No matter -- take the time you need to raise the money. I want her ladyship to be well looked after.
dlga_lord_marriage_permission_endowment_answer_delay:lord_pretalk.1|That is a shame, but I would be remiss in my duty if I allowed her ladyship to face an uncertain future.
dlga_lord_talk_ask_something_2:lord_courtship_permission|{s10} I have the honor of visiting with {s14}{s12}?
dlga_lord_courtship_permission:lord_pretalk|From what I hear, you have already spoken to her -- without my permission. Let me tell you this: I am her lord and guardian, and I have plans for her. I will not be mocked behind my back as a man who cannot control the women of his household. I would ask you not to discuss this matter with me again.
dlga_lord_courtship_permission:lord_pretalk.1|{s14}
dlga_lord_courtship_permission:lord_pretalk.2|{s12}
dlga_lord_talk_ask_something_2:lord_talk_ask_marriage_1|What would it take to cement a lasting alliance with your house?
dlga_lord_talk:lord_jeanne_rebell|What do you think of the rebels?
dlga_lord_jeanne_rebell:lord_talk|They are the children of France, it is for them that I fight and endure all this.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_jeanne_angll|What do you think of your enemies, the English?
dlga_lord_jeanne_angll:lord_talk|I pity them, they do not obey the King of Heaven. They will lose all the battles before losing their souls.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_jeanne_slys|What can you tell me about the company of Freelancers?
dlga_lord_jeanne_slys:lord_talk|They are very good soldiers. I pray that the Dauphin still has money to pay. If the Englishmen were to summon their services, we would be in trouble.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_chharl_rebell|What do you think of the rebels?
dlga_lord_chharl_rebell:lord_talk|They are committed to our host. They conduct a parallel battle and sometimes give the impression of fighting also against us. But as they hinder the English and the Burgundians, they will be useful to our plans.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_chharl_bretagne|What do you think of the Duchy of Brittany?
dlga_lord_chharl_bretagne:lord_talk|We hope to improve our relations with the Duchy of Brittany. But if they were to oppose some of our claims we have to fight them.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_chharl_slys|Can I ask your opinion on the company of Freelancers, sire?
dlga_lord_chharl_slys:lord_talk|These are my best foot soldiers, the bravest and boldest of mercenaries. If there was no more gold, I don't believe they would still remain in my service, but that is not the case currently.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_hennryy_rebell|What do you think of the rebels?
dlga_lord_hennryy_rebell:lord_talk|Hmm... they give the popular impression of being romantic heroes, but the reality is quite different. They are only vagabonds and lousy thieves. I'd like to finish them soon. I want to continue spending my gold to maintain the troops once we have won the war, because even defeated these dogs continue to keep me awake at night.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_kniiight1_rebell|What do you think of the rebels?
dlga_lord_kniiight1_rebell:lord_talk|What do you mean? These are French and fight aside ours. Any help is welcome, though I do not understand why they don't join the army of the Dauphin? Maybe they think would be sacrificed, which is not the case. They would be directed more effectively instead... at least I hope.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_kniiight1_slys|What do you think of the company of Freelancers?
dlga_lord_kniiight1_slys:lord_talk|This is the best company of the Dauphin, highly skilled men and brave soldiers, very disciplined. What they do outside of combat does not concern me.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_hiirre_rebell|What do you think of the rebels?
dlga_lord_hiirre_rebell:lord_talk|Between us... I think they aren't stupid, they know they have better than average equipment so they enlisted in the host. But these farmers also know that they constitute the first line of defense. I think they are mostly commanded by people more malignant than them.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_hiirre_lyys|What do you think of the Freelancers?
dlga_lord_hiirre_lyys:lord_talk|I fought alongside them at the Battle of Verneuil, these are great soldiers. Even though we had the victory taken away from our grasp that day, the situation is changing.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_alleencon_rebell|What do you think of the rebels?
dlga_lord_alleencon_rebell:lord_talk|The rank and file is disorganized and absolutely worthless. They walk the roads like cattle just waiting to be caught and keep running after patrols... what a mess.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_alleencon_slys|What do you think the company of Freelancers?
dlga_lord_alleencon_slys:lord_talk|This company is the best that we can afford. If they are fortunate, their price is equal to their service. But this troop is really worth their pay, their motto is to never let go of their position. Their leader is forbidden to die, which is the fun part, but they are respectable we all agree.
dlga_lord_alleencon_rebell:lord_talk.1|Not interested... another question?
dlga_lord_talk:lord_alleencon_lyis|What do you think of... Freelancers, the mercenaries?
dlga_lord_alleencon_lyis:lord_talk|I feel they occasionally present themselves as noble, just because they carry a personal banner. The Dauphin should reform it and send half of its most incompetent troops away. I reminded him of that recently. That said the Freelancers is an important and indispensable company, all subjects of the Kingdom, which is convenient.
dlga_lord_talk_ask_something_2:lord_pretalk|Never mind.
dlga_lord_talk_ask_location:lord_talk_ask_location_2|Very well, I may or may not have an answer for you. About whom do you wish to hear?

dlga_lord_talk_ask_location_2:lady_pretalk|Never mind.

dlga_lord_strategy_follow_evaluation:lord_talk_ask_something_2|Did you have any other questions?
dlga_lord_strategy_follow_evaluation:lord_strategy_follow_up|Our leader {s4} is far too cautious. {reg4?He:She} should either use the army to attack the enemy, or let it go home.
dlga_lord_strategy_follow_evaluation:lord_strategy_follow_up.1|Our army sits, doing nothing. Apparently, too few vassals have answered the call to arms. Perhaps {s4} does not enjoy the confidence of the great lords of this realm.
dlga_lord_strategy_follow_evaluation:lord_strategy_follow_up.2|I disagree with this strategy. I would prefer to {s4}.
dlga_lord_strategy_follow_evaluation:lord_strategy_follow_up.3|I personally would prefer to attack {s8}, but our marshal {s10} believes that it {s9}
dlga_lord_strategy_follow_evaluation:lord_strategy_follow_up.4|I personally would prefer to defend {s8}, instead of {s9}.
dlga_lord_strategy_follow_evaluation:lord_talk|Is there anything else?
dlga_lord_strategy_follow_evaluation:lord_strategy_follow_up.5|This strategy seems reasonable to me.
dlga_lord_strategy_follow_up:lord_strategy_why_not|If you're attacking, why aren't you...
dlga_lord_strategy_follow_up:lord_talk_ask_something_again|I see....
dlga_lord_strategy_follow_up:lord_talk_replace_marshal|Would you say, then, that {s4} should no longer be marshal?
dlga_lord_talk_replace_marshal:lord_talk_ask_something_again|I believe that our realm should resolve the issue of {s4} before we begin to debate replacing the marshal.
dlga_lord_talk_replace_marshal:lord_talk_ask_something_again.1|Yes. I have already made my position on this matter clear. I believe that {s4} should be marshal instead of {s5}.
dlga_lord_talk_replace_marshal:lord_talk_ask_something_again.2|I will make up my mind on this matter without your persuasion, {sir/my lady}.
dlga_lord_talk_replace_marshal:lord_talk_replace_marshal_decision|Hmm...
dlga_lord_talk_replace_marshal_decision:lord_talk_ask_something_again|Yes, I would say that. At this point, I would be tempted to say that I support {s15} instead. I am glad that you and I had this discussion, so that I know that we are of the same mind on this matter.
dlga_lord_talk_replace_marshal_decision:lord_talk_ask_something_again.1|Not necessarily. It is possible for {s4} and I have to have an honest disagreement over strategy, without my seeking to replace him.

dlga_lord_marriage_proposal_female_pc_next_step_5:lord_marriage_proposal_female_pc_confirm_engagement|Very well, then.

dlga_lord_ask_enter_service:lord_ask_enter_service_female_2|My lady, you seem to have the makings of a good war leader. For a woman to show such skill is an uncommon thing in France, but not completely without precedent. Noblewomen have often taken command of armies after their husbands or fathers were slain or captured, for example.
dlga_lord_ask_enter_service_female_2:lord_ask_enter_service_female_response|However, I have never heard of a king who granted a fief to a woman, no matter how valorous, simply because he needed an extra vassal. Were I to do such a thing, I would raise eyebrows across France. Men would say that I was besotted or bewitched, or that I aimed to overturn the natural order of things. As much as I regret it, I cannot afford to grant you a fief.
dlga_lord_ask_enter_service_female_response:lord_ask_enter_service_female_solution_capture|What if I were to take one of your enemy's castles by force?
dlga_lord_ask_enter_service_female_response:lord_ask_enter_service_female_solution_marriage|What if I were to marry one of your lords?
dlga_lord_ask_enter_service_female_response:lord_ask_enter_service_female_solution_competitor|Perhaps one of your competitors will prove to be more open-minded.
dlga_lord_ask_enter_service_female_response:lord_ask_enter_service|I would be willing to fight for you, even without the fief.
dlga_lord_ask_enter_service_female_response:lord_pretalk|Never mind.
dlga_lord_ask_enter_service_female_solution_marriage:lord_ask_enter_service_female_response|Well, I still would not be willing to grant you any fiefs. However, you would no doubt have the use of your husband's properties, which would allow you to act as one of my vassals in all but name. Did you have an other questions?
dlga_lord_ask_enter_service_female_solution_competitor:lord_ask_enter_service_female_response|Oh, perhaps you might find someone who was truly desperate -- but then, I would think, they would not have many fiefs to bestow. Did you have an other questions?
dlga_lord_ask_enter_service_female_solution_capture:lord_ask_enter_service_female_response|Well, in that case, depending on the circumstances, I might be inclined to let you keep it. Did you have an other questions?
dlga_lord_ask_enter_service:lord_give_oath_1|You are known as a brave {man-at-arms/warrior} and a fine leader of men, {playername}. I shall be pleased to accept your sword into my service and bestow vassalage upon you, if you are ready to swear homage to me.

dlga_lord_give_oath_2:lord_give_oath_3|Good. Then repeat the words of the oath with me: I swear homage to you as lawful ruler of the {s41}.
dlga_lord_give_oath_3:lord_give_oath_4|I pledge homage to you as lawful ruler of the {s41}.

dlga_lord_give_oath_10:lord_give_oath_go_on_2|Very well. You have given me your solemn oath, {playername}. May you uphold it always, with proper courage and devotion.
dlga_lord_give_oath_go_on_2:lord_give_oath_go_on_3|Let it be known that from this day forward, you are my sworn {man/follower} and vassal. I give you my protection and grant you the right to bear arms in my name, and I pledge that I shall not deprive you of your life, liberty or properties except by the lawful judgment of your peers or by the law and custom of the land.{reg1?

dlga_lord_enter_service_swear:lord_enter_service_swear_accepted|I do so swear, {s65}.
dlga_lord_enter_service_swear:lord_enter_service_swear_denied|I need some time to think about this.

dlga_lord_enter_service_swear_accepted_2:close_window|I charge you with rooting out and destroying the forces of our enemies wherever you may find them. Moreover, I will have special tasks for you from time to time, as may some of my other vassal lords. Serve, fight, and honour your oaths. These things will take you far, if you've a mind for promotion. May God grant us long lives and many victories to toast in my hall!
dlga_lord_ask_leave_service:lord_ask_leave_service_verify|Hrm. Has your oath become burdensome, {playername}? It is unusual to request release from homage, but in respect of your fine service, I will not hold you if you truly wish to end it. Though you would be sorely missed.
dlga_lord_ask_leave_service:lord_ask_leave_service_verify.1|Release from homage? Hmm, perhaps it would be for the best... However, {playername}, you must be sure that release is what you desire. This is not a thing done lightly.
dlga_lord_ask_leave_service_verify:lord_ask_leave_service_2|It is something I must do, {s65}.
dlga_lord_ask_leave_service_verify:lord_ask_leave_service_giveup|You are right, {s65}. My place is here.
dlga_lord_ask_leave_service_giveup:lord_pretalk|I am pleased to hear it, {playername}. I hope you'll banish such unworthy thoughts from your mind from now on.
dlga_lord_ask_leave_service_2:lord_ask_leave_service_verify_again|Then you are sure? Also, be aware that if you leave my services, you will be surrendering to me all the fiefs which you hold in my name.
dlga_lord_ask_leave_service_verify_again:lord_ask_leave_service_3|Yes, {s65}.
dlga_lord_ask_leave_service_verify_again:lord_ask_leave_service_giveup|Of course not, {s65}. I am ever your loyal vassal.
dlga_lord_ask_leave_service_3:lord_ask_leave_service_end|As you wish. I hereby declare your oaths to be null and void. You will no longer hold land or titles in my name, and you are released from your duties to my house. You are free, {playername}.

dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_collect_taxes_fail|Unfortunately, a revolt broke up while I was collecting the taxes. I could only collect {reg19} crowns.
dlga_lord_collect_taxes_success:lord_pretalk|Well done, {playername}, very well done indeed! You were truly the right {man/person} for the job. I promised you a fifth of the taxes, so that amounts to {reg21} crowns. If you give me {reg20} crowns, you may keep the difference. A good result for everyone, eh?
dlga_lord_collect_taxes_half_success:lord_pretalk|What?! Is this some scheme of yours, {playername}? That's less than half the taxes I'm owed! You have let them get away with murder as well as my money. What a farce!

dlga_lord_collect_taxes_fail:lord_pretalk|God, what a bloody mess you've gotten us into, {playername}.This could turn very ugly if I do not take immediate action.I certainly hope you're not here expecting to be paid for failure.Hand over my {reg19} crowns, if you please, and end our business together.

dlga_lord_hunt_down_fugitive_success_2:lord_hunt_down_fugitive_reward_reject|This is blood money. I can't accept it.
dlga_lord_hunt_down_fugitive_reward_accept:lord_pretalk|Of course, {playername}. Here you are. Once again, you've my thanks for ridding me of that {s43}.
dlga_lord_hunt_down_fugitive_reward_reject:lord_pretalk|You are a {man/woman} for whom justice is its own reward, eh? As you wish it, {playername}, as you wish it. An honourable sentiment, to be true. Regardless, you've my thanks for ridding me of that {s43}.
dlga_lord_hunt_down_fugitive_fail:lord_pretalk|It is a sad day when that {s43} manages to avoid the hand of justice yet again. I thought you would be able to do this, {playername}. Clearly I was wrong.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_active_mission_3|I am still working on it.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_mission_failed|I am afraid I won't be able to do this quest.
dlga_lord_active_mission_3:lord_pretalk|Good. Remember, I am counting on you.
dlga_lord_mission_failed:lord_pretalk|{s43}
dlga_lord_suggets_attack_enemy_castle3:lord_pretalk|That should be possible. Very well, we'll attack {s1}.
dlga_lord_propose_mercenary:lord_mercenary_service|As it happens, {playername}, I promised {s10} that I would hire a company of mercenaries for an upcoming campaign.
dlga_lord_mercenary_service:lord_mercenary_service_reject|I'm not interested, thank you.
dlga_lord_mercenary_service:lord_mercenary_service_accept|Aye, I'll join {s9}.
dlga_lord_mercenary_service:lord_mercenary_elaborate_pay|I'm interested. Please tell me more.
dlga_lord_mercenary_service_accept:lord_mercenary_service_verify|Perfect. Of course you shall have to make a formal declaration of allegiance, and give your oath that you and your company will remain in service to {s9} for a period of no less than one month.
dlga_lord_mercenary_service_verify:lord_mercenary_service_verify_2|As you wish. Your enemies are my enemies.
dlga_lord_mercenary_service_verify:lord_mercenary_service_reject|On second thought, forget it.
dlga_lord_mercenary_service_verify_2:lord_mercenary_service_accept_3|That will do. You've made a wise choice, my friend. {s9} does well by its loyal fighters, you will receive many rewards for your service.
dlga_lord_mercenary_service_accept_3:lord_pretalk|Now, I suggest you prepare for a serious campaign. Train and equip your soldiers as best you can in the meantime, and respond quickly when you are summoned for duty.
dlga_lord_mercenary_service_reject:lord_pretalk|I'm very sorry to hear that. You'll find no better place than {s9}, be sure of that.
dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_pay:lord_mercenary_elaborate_1|I can offer you a contract for one month. At the end of this period, it can be extended on a monthly basis. An initial sum of {reg12} crowns will be paid to you to seal the contract. After that, you'll receive wages from {s10} each week, according to the number and quality of the soldiers in your company. You still have your rights to battlefield loot and salvage, as well as any prisoners you capture. War can be very profitable at times...
dlga_lord_mercenary_service_elaborate_duty:lord_mercenary_elaborate_1|Duties... There are only a few, none of them difficult. The very first thing is to declare your allegiance. An oath of loyalty to our cause. Once that's done, you shall be required to fulfill certain responsibilities. You'll participate in military campaigns, fulfill any duties given to you by your commanders, and most of all you shall attack the enemies of our kingdom wherever you might find them.
dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_1:lord_mercenary_service_elaborate_duty|And what about my duties as a mercenary?

dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_1:lord_mercenary_elaborate_pay|How much will you pay me for my service?
dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_1:lord_mercenary_service_accept|Sounds good. I wish to enter your service as a mercenary.

dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_castle:lord_mercenary_elaborate_1|Only my loyal vassals can own lands and castles in my realm -- and all my vassals are men.\I am not inclined to depart from this tradition without a very good reason. If you prove yourself in battle, you can swear an oath of homage to me and become my vassal.\We may then discuss how you may obtain a castle.
dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_castle:lord_mercenary_elaborate_1.1|Hmm... Only loyal vassals of {s10} can own lands and castles. While kings will sometimes accept vassalage from men who prove themselves in battle, and grant them land, I have never heard of a king who gave fiefs to women. You had best discuss that issue with {s10} himself.
dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_castle:lord_mercenary_elaborate_1.2|Only my loyal vassals can own lands and castles in my realm. A mercenary can not be trusted with such a responsibility. However, after serving for some time, you can swear homage to me and become my vassal. Then you will be rewarded with a fief.

dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_banner:lord_mercenary_elaborate_1|Only my noble vassals have the honour of carrying their own banners.

dlga_lord_request_mission_ask:lord_tell_mission|A task?
dlga_lord_request_mission_ask:lord_pretalk.2|My lady, by the traditions of courtship, I should be offering my services to you. Unfortunately, I have little time right now, so I beg you to take this declaration of my esteem in its place.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_sworn_vassal|There are some minor errands which I need completed, but it would be more appropriate to give them to one of my own men, not to a sworn vassal of the realm.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_sworn_vassal:lord_pretalk|If you are looking for action against our foes, you may join our attack on {s4}. The enemy may come in force to oppose us, so it is good to have as many men as possible.

dlga_lord_tell_mission_sworn_vassal:lord_pretalk.3|If a worthy task presents itself, however, I may have a favor to ask of you at a later date.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:destroy_lair_quest_brief|Yes -- there is something you can do for us. We have heard reports that a group of {s4} have established a hideout in this area, and have been attacking travellers. If you could find their lair and destroy it, we would be very grateful.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_rescue_prisoner|My {s11}, {s13}, has been taken prisoner by {s14} of the {s15}. Normally, honorable nobles will grant prisoners of gentle blood the privilege of parole, and treat them as honored guests so long as they give their word that they will not attempt to escape, until such time as a ransom can be paid.  But {s14}, instead of granting {s13} parole, has consigned my {s11} to his dungeons -- no doubt in the hope that he can demand more from us.
dlga_lord_mission_rescue_prisoner:lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_confirm|We need you to get my {s11} out of prison. You may be able to pay a ransom -- in which case we could cover your expenses, up to 5000 crowns. If you have connections within {s24}, you may be able to use them to sneak him out. Or, you may try a more direct approach -- walk up to the gaoler, take the keys by force, and then fight your way out. Can you do this for us?
dlga_lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_confirm:lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_accepted|I can try.
dlga_lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_confirm:lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_rejected|I don't think that I can help you.
dlga_lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_rejected:close_window|It would not have been an easy task. Perhaps we will find another way.

dlga_lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_method:lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_method_prisonbreak|I am thinking of breaking into the prison in {s24}, finding {s13}, and fighting my way out.
dlga_lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_method:lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_method_siege|I am thinking of taking {s24} by storm.
dlga_lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_method:lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_planning_end|I have done enough planning. Time to act!
dlga_lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_planning_end:close_window|May the heavens protect you.
dlga_lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_method_prisonbreak:lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_method_prisonbreak_2|I had discussed this idea with some of my men. One could enter {s24}, either in disguise or openly, then walk up to the prison guard and try to take the keys by force. However, getting out may be difficult. The garrison may be slow to react, but even so, you are likely to find yourself fighting a half dozen or more of the enemy at once, with limited space in which to maneuver. If you can fight your way past them, though, you can probably get out.
dlga_lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_method_prisonbreak_2:lord_mission_rescue_other_ideas|You may find it useful to create a distraction, to divert the attention of some of the garrison. If you have any connections in the villages near {s24}, this may be a time to put them to use.
dlga_lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_method_siege:lord_mission_rescue_other_ideas|Well, that is certainly the most direct approach.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_deliver_message|I need to send a letter to {s13} who should be currently at {s4}. If you will be heading towards there, would you deliver it to him? The letter needs to be in his hands in 30 days.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message:lord_mission_deliver_message_accepted|Certainly, I intend to pass by {s4} and it would be no trouble.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message:lord_mission_deliver_message_rejected|I doubt I'll be seeing {s13} anytime soon, {s65}. You'd best send it with someone else.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message:lord_mission_deliver_message_rejected_rudely|I am no errand boy, sir. Hire a courier for your trivialities.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message_accepted:close_window|I appreciate it, {playername}. Here's the letter, and a small sum to cover your travel expenses. Give my regards to {s13} when you see him.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message_rejected:lord_pretalk|Ah, all right then. Well, I am sure I will find someone else.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message_rejected_rudely:lord_mission_deliver_message_rejected_rudely_2|Hmm, is this how you respond to a polite request for a small favor? A poor show, {playername}. I didn't know you would take offence.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message_rejected_rudely_2:lord_mission_deliver_message_rejected_rudely_3|Then you shall know better from now on.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message_rejected_rudely_2:lord_mission_deliver_message_accepted|Forgive my temper, {s65}. I'll deliver your letter.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message_rejected_rudely_3:close_window|All right. I will remember that.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_deliver_message.1|I need to deliver a letter to {s13} of {s15}, who must be at {s4} currently. If you are going towards there, would you deliver my letter to him? The letter needs to reach him in 40 days.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told|There is a small thing... My {s17} {s13} is due for a visit to her relatives at {s14}. The visit has been postponed several times already with all the trouble on the roads, but this time she is adamant about going. So, I want to at least make sure she's well-guarded. I trust you well, {playername} so I would be very grateful if you could escort her to {s14} and make sure she arrives safe and sound.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_deal_with_bandits_told|A group of bandits have taken refuge in my village of {s15}. They are plundering nearby farms, and getting rich and fat stealing my taxes and feasting on my cattle.I'd like nothing better than to go out there and teach them a lesson, but I have my hands full at the moment, so I can't do anything about it.
dlga_lord_mission_deal_with_bandits_told:lord_mission_deal_with_bandits_accepted|Worry not, I can go to {s15} and deal with these scum for you.

dlga_lord_tell_mission_raise_troops:lord_tell_mission_raise_troops_2|How many men do you need?
dlga_lord_tell_mission_raise_troops_2:lord_mission_raise_troops_told|If you can raise {reg1} {s14} and bring them to me, that will probably be enough.
dlga_lord_mission_raise_troops_told:lord_mission_raise_troops_accepted|Of course, {s65}. Give me {reg1} fresh recruits and I'll train them to be {s14}.
dlga_lord_mission_raise_troops_told:lord_mission_raise_troops_rejected|I am too busy these days to train anyone.
dlga_lord_mission_raise_troops_accepted:close_window|You've taken a weight off my shoulders, {playername}. I shall tell my sergeants to send you the recruits and attach them to your command. Also, I'll advance you some money to help with expenses. Here, this purse should do it. Thank you for your help.
dlga_lord_mission_raise_troops_rejected:lord_pretalk|Oh, of course. I had expected as much. Well, good luck to you then.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_collect_taxes_told|You probably know that I am the lord of the {reg9?town:village} of {s3}. However, it has been months since {s3} has delivered the taxes and rents due me as its rightful lord. Apparently the populace there has grown unruly lately and I need someone to go there and remind them of their obligations. And to . . . persuade them if they won't listen. If you go there and raise the taxes they owe me, I will grant you one-fifth of everything you collect.
dlga_lord_mission_collect_taxes_told:lord_mission_collect_taxes_accepted|A fair offer, {s65}. We have an agreement.
dlga_lord_mission_collect_taxes_told:lord_mission_collect_taxes_rejected|Forgive me, I don't have the time.
dlga_lord_mission_collect_taxes_accepted:close_window|Welcome news, {playername}. I will entrust this matter to you. Remember, those {reg9?townsmen:peasants} are foxy beasts, they will make every excuse not to pay me my rightful incomes. Do not let them fool you.
dlga_lord_mission_collect_taxes_rejected:lord_pretalk|Oh, yes. Well, good luck to you then.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_told|I have something you could help with, an issue with the lawless villain known as {s4}.  He murdered one of my men and has been on the run from his judgment ever since. I can't let him get away with avoiding justice, so I've put a bounty of 300 crowns on his head. Friends of the murdered man reckon that this assassin may have taken refuge with his kinsmen at {s3}. You might be able to hunt him down and give him what he deserves, and claim the bounty for yourself.
dlga_lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_told:lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_accepted|Then I will hunt him down and execute the law.
dlga_lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_told:lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_rejected|I am too busy to go after him at the moment.
dlga_lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_accepted:close_window|That's excellent, {playername}. I will be grateful to you and so will the family of the man he murdered. And of course the bounty on his head will be yours if you can get him. Well, good hunting to you.
dlga_lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_rejected:lord_pretalk|As you wish, {playername}.I suppose there are plenty of bounty hunters around to get the job done . . .
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told_kill_local_merchant|The wretched truth is that I owe a considerable sum of money to one of the merchants here in {s3}. I've no intention of paying it back, of course, but that loud-mouthed fool is making a terrible fuss about it. He even had the audacity to come and threaten me -- me! -- with a letter of complaint to the trade guilds and bankers. Why, he'd ruin my good reputation! So I need a {man/woman} I can trust, someone who will guarantee the man's silence. For good.
dlga_lord_mission_told_kill_local_merchant:lord_mission_accepted_kill_local_merchant|Worry not, he shan't breathe a word.

dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told_meet_spy_in_enemy_town|I have a sensitive matter which needs tending to, {playername}, and no trustworthy retainers to take care of it.

dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_2:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_response|You shall have to use stealth. Take care to avoid enemy strongholds, villages and patrols, and don't bring too many men with you.

dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_response:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_3|How will I recognise the spy?
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_3:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_response|Once you get to {s13} you must talk to the locals, the spy will be one of them. If you think you've found the spy, say the phrase '{s11}' The spy will respond with the phrase '{s12}' Thus you will know the other, and {reg7?she:he} will give you any information {reg7?she:he}'s gathered in my service.

dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_rejected:lord_pretalk|As you wish, {playername}, but I strongly advise you to forget anything I told you about any spies. They do not exist, have never existed, and no one will ever find them. Remember that.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told_raid_caravan_to_start_war|This peace with {s13} ill suits me, {playername}. We've let those swine have their way for far too long. Now they get stronger with each passing and their arrogance knows no bounds. I say, we must wage war on them before it's too late!

dlga_lord_mission_told_raid_caravan_to_start_war:lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_2|You are right, {s65}, but what can we do?
dlga_lord_mission_told_raid_caravan_to_start_war:quest_raid_caravan_to_start_war_rejected_1|I disagree, sir. It is better that there be peace.

As a matter of fact, there is something we can do, {playername}. A little bit of provocation... If one of our war parties managed to enter their territory and pillage one of their caravans, or raided one of their villages, and perhaps left behind a little token or two of the {s14}, they would have ample cause to declare war on us. And then, well, even the cowards among us must rise to defend themselves. So what do you say? Are you interested?
dlga_lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_3:quest_raid_caravan_to_start_war_accepted|An excellent plan. Count me in.

dlga_lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_4:lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_5|Well, {playername}, some of the lords in our kingdom won't like the idea of someone inciting a war without their consent. They are already looking for an excuse to get at me, and if I did this they could make me pay for it dearly. You, on the other hand, are young and well-liked and daring, so you might just get away with it. And of course I will back you up and defend your actions against your opponents. All in all, a few lords might be upset at your endeavour, but I am sure you won't be bothered with that.
dlga_lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_5:quest_raid_caravan_to_start_war_accepted|That seems reasonable. I am willing to do this.

dlga_quest_raid_caravan_to_start_war_accepted:close_window|Very good! A raid on a caravan, or, if you can't manage that, an attack on one of their villages, should do the trick. Now, good luck and good hunting. Go set the borders aflame!
dlga_quest_raid_caravan_to_start_war_rejected_1:lord_pretalk|Ah, you think so? But how long will your precious peace last? Not long, believe me.
dlga_quest_raid_caravan_to_start_war_rejected_2:lord_pretalk|Hmm. As you wish, {playername}. I thought you had some fire in you, but it seems I was wrong.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told.1|Well, some of the serfs working my fields in {s4} have run away. The ungrateful swine, I let them plough my fields and rent my cottages, and this is how they repay me!

I want you to capture all three groups and fetch them back to {s4} by whatever means necessary.

He should be seized and hanged for his impudence, but we also believe that very soon he will leave town to meet with his master, the man to whom the spy feeds all his little whispers.

dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy:lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_2|I want you to wait here until the spy leaves town. Then you must follow him, stealthily, to the meeting place.

Alive, if you please.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_2:lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_accepted|I'll do it, {s65}.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_2:lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_rejected|No, this skulking is not for me.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_accepted:close_window|Good, I'm sure you'll do a fine job of it. One of my men will point the spy out to you when he leaves, so you will know the man to follow. Remember, I want them both, and I want them alive.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_rejected:lord_pretalk|A shame. Well, carry on as you were, {playername}...
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero|There is a difficult job I need done, {playername}, and you may be the {man/one} who can carry it off. I need someone to capture one of the noble lords of {s13} and bring him to me. Afterwards, I'll be able to exchange him in return for a relative of mine held by {s13}. It is a simple enough job, but whomever you choose will be guarded by an elite band of personal retainers. Are you up for a fight?
dlga_lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero:lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero_accepted|Consider it done, {s65}.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero:lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero_rejected|I must refuse, {s65}. I am not a kidnapper.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero_accepted:close_window|I like your spirit! Go and bring me one of our enemies, and I'll toast your name in my hall when you return! And reward you for your efforts, of course...
dlga_lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero_rejected:lord_pretalk|Clearly you lack the mettle I had thought you possessed. Very well, {playername}, I will find someone else.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_lend_companion|I don't have a job for you right now, but your companion {s3} is a skilled {reg3?lass:fellow} and I need someone with {reg3?her:his} talents. Will you lend {reg3?her:him} to me for a while?
dlga_lord_tell_mission_lend_companion:lord_tell_mission_lend_companion_2|How long will you be needing {reg3?her:him}?
dlga_lord_tell_mission_lend_companion_2:lord_mission_lend_companion_told|Just a few days, a week at most.
dlga_lord_mission_lend_companion_told:lord_tell_mission_lend_companion_accepted|Then I will leave {s3} with you for one week.
dlga_lord_mission_lend_companion_told:lord_tell_mission_lend_companion_rejected|I am sorry, but I cannot do without {s3} for a whole week.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_lend_companion_accepted:close_window|I cannot thank you enough, {playername}. Worry not, your companion shall be returned to you with due haste.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_lend_companion_rejected:lord_pretalk|Well, that's damned unfortunate, but I suppose I cannot force you or {s3} to agree. I shall have to make do without.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_collect_debt|Some time ago, I loaned out a considerable sum of money to {s3}. {reg4} crowns, to be precise. He was supposed to pay it back within a month but I haven't received a copper from him since. That was months ago. If you could collect the debt from him on my behalf, I would be grateful indeed. I would even let you keep one fifth of the money for your trouble. What do you say?
dlga_lord_tell_mission_collect_debt:lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_2|Do you know where I can find {s3}, {s65}?
dlga_lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_2:lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_3|If you leave now, you should be able to find him at {s4}. I've no doubt that he will be suitably embarrassed by his conduct and give you all the money he owes me.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_3:lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_accepted|Then I will talk to {s3} on your behalf.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_3:lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_rejected|Forgive me, {s65}, but I doubt I would be more successful than yourself.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_accepted:close_window|You made me very happy by accepting this {playername}. Please, talk to {s3} and don't leave him without my money.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_rejected:lord_pretalk|Perhaps not, {playername}. I suppose I'm never getting that money back...
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander|I tell you, that blubbering fool {s13} is not fit to rule {s14}. God knows he would be divested of his lands in an instant were it not for one of his loyal vassals, {s15}. As long as he has his vassal aiding him, it will be a difficult job beating him. So I need to get {s15} out of the picture, and I have a plan just to do that... With your help, naturally.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_2|{s66}, I am all ears.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_rejected|I don't wish to involve myself in anything dishonourable against {s15}.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_rejected:lord_pretalk|Dishonourable? Bah! I was hoping I could count on you, {playername}, but you've shown me what a fool I was. I shall have to find someone whose loyalty I can trust.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_2:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_3|I have written a fake letter to {s15}, bearing my own seal, which implicates him in a conspiracy with us to stage a coup in {s14}, in my favour. If we can make {s13} believe the letter is genuine, he will deal with {s15} very swiftly. Of course, the challenge there is to convince {s13} that the letter is indeed real...
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_3:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_4|Please continue, {s65}...
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_3:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_rejected|No, I will not sully myself with this dishonourable scheme.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_4:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_5|This is where you come into play. You'll take the letter to {s14}, then give it to one of your soldiers and instruct him to take it to {s15}. I will have one of my spies inform the town garrison so that your man will be arrested on his way. The guards will then find the letter and take it to {s13}. They'll torture your man, of course, to try and get the truth out of him, but all he knows is that you ordered the letter to be delivered to {s15} under the utmost secrecy. {s13} knows you serve me, and the fool will certainly believe the whole charade.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_5:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_7|Is that all?
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_7:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_8|There is one more thing... Your messenger must be someone trustworthy. If you sent the letter with a simple peasant, someone expendable, {s13} might suspect a plot. He may have the wits of a snail, but even a snail can see the obvious. Give the letter to someone of rank. One of your {s9}, perhaps.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_8:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_9|What? I can't send one of my trusted {s9} to his death!
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_8:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_fin|Then a {s8} it will be.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_9:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_10|Come now, {playername}. There is a place for sentimentality, but this is not it. Believe me, you shall be generously compensated, and what is the purpose of soldiers if not to die at our say-so?
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_10:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_fin|A {s8} it is.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_10:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_rejected|No, I'll not sacrifice one of my chosen men.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_fin:lord_pretalk|I can't tell you how pleased I am to hear that, {playername}. You are removing one of the greatest obstacles in my path. Here is the letter, as well as 300 crowns for your expenses. Remember, there'll be more once you succeed. Much, much more...
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told.2|A group of my soldiers were captured in a recent skirmish with the enemy. Thankfully we have a mutual agreement of prisoner exchange, and they will release my men, but they want us to give them prisoners of equal rank and number. Prisoners I don't currently have. So, I need a good {man/warrior} to find me {reg1} {s3} as prisoners, that I may exchange them.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_pretalk|No {playername}. I do not need your help at this time.
dlga_lord_mission_told:lord_mission_accepted|You can count on me, {s65}.

dlga_lord_leave:lord_leave_give_quest|Before you go, {playername}, I have something to ask of you... We may be enemies in this war, but I pray that you believe, as I do, that we can still be civil towards each other. Thus I hoped that you would be kind enough to assist me in something important to me.
dlga_lord_leave_give_quest:enemy_lord_tell_mission|I am listening.
dlga_enemy_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told|I have a friend here, an old warrior, who is very sick. Pestilence has infected an old battle wound, and unless he is seen to by a surgeon soon, he will surely die. This man is dear to me, {playername}, but he's also stubborn as a hog and refuses to have anyone look at his injury because he doesn't trust the physicians here. I have heard that you've a capable surgeon with you. If you would let your surgeon come here and have a look, {reg3?she:he} may be able to convince him to give his consent to an operation. Please, I will be deeply indebted to you if you grant me this request.

And food, of course.  Plenty of room for promotion and you'll be equipped as befits your rank. You'll have your take of what you can scavange in battle, too.  What do you say?
dlga_lord_request_enlistment_confirm:close_window|Seems a fair lot and steady work in these lands. I'm with you, my {reg3?Lady:Lord}.
dlga_lord_request_enlistment_confirm:lord_pretalk|Well, on second thought my {reg3?Lady:Lord}, I might try my luck alone a bit longer. My thanks.
dlga_lord_request_enlistment:lord_pretalk|I do not trust you enough to allow you to serve for me.
dlga_lord_request_retire:lord_pretalk|Very well {playername}. You are relieved of duty.
dlga_lord_request_vacation:lord_pretalk|Very well {playername}. You shall take some time off from military duty. Return in {reg3} days.

dlga_tailor_custom_armor_choose:tailor_custom_armor_confirm|Very well {sir/madam}, it will cost you {reg0} crowns.
dlga_tailor_custom_armor_confirm:town_merchant_finish|The price seems fair to me.
dlga_tailor_custom_armor_confirm:town_merchant_finish.1|[Persuasion {reg1}] Make it {reg0} crowns and I'll put out a good word about your shop.
dlga_tailor_custom_armor_confirm:town_merchant_finish.2|[Trade {reg1}] I'm certain {reg0} crowns would be a more appropriate price.
dlga_tailor_custom_armor_confirm:close_window|I'm afraid that I can't afford it...
dlga_tailor_custom_armor_confirm:close_window.1|Perhaps later.
dlga_town_merchant_finish:close_window|I'll work on it straight away.
dlga_lord_leave_prison:close_window|We'll meet again.

dlga_lady_journey_1:close_window|I am doing quite fine, {playername}. Thank you for your concern.
dlga_start:spouse_talk|Yes, my husband?

dlga_wedding_ceremony_vows_complete:close_window|I now declare you and {s3} to be husband and wife. Go now to the chamber prepared for you, and we shall make arrangements for your bride to join you in your hall in {s11}.
dlga_spouse_pretalk:spouse_talk|Is there anything else, my {husband/wife}?
dlga_spouse_organize_feast:spouse_pretalk|A splendid idea, my {husband/wife}. However, let us wait for the current feast here to conclude, before organizing another.
dlga_spouse_organize_feast:spouse_pretalk.1|A splendid idea, my {husband/wife}. However, we must establish a court before hosting a feast.
dlga_spouse_organize_feast:spouse_pretalk.2|A splendid idea, my {husband/wife}. However, our realm has recently had a feast. Perhaps we should wait another {reg3} days before we organize another one.
dlga_spouse_organize_feast:spouse_evaluate_larder_for_feast|A splendid idea, my {husband/wife}. However, to not insult our guests, we must make sure that we can provide a large and varied repast, for the lords, their families, and their retinues. All told, we should count on a couple of hundred mouths to feed, over several days. Let us take an inventory of our household possessions...

dlga_spouse_feast_confirm:spouse_feast_added_items|Let me add more items to our storehouses

dlga_spouse_feast_confirm:spouse_feast_confirm_yes|Let us dispatch the invitations
dlga_spouse_feast_confirm:spouse_pretalk|Let us wait, then
dlga_spouse_feast_confirm_yes:spouse_pretalk|I shall send word, then, that we will host a feast as soon as conditions in the realm permit. You perhaps should continue to stock our larder, so that we may do justice to our reputation for hospitality.

dlga_start:kingdom_lady_captive.1|You are a cad, {sir/madame}, to hold a lady like this...
dlga_start:kingdom_lady_captive.2|It is strange. On occasion you have shown me such kindness, and yet you continue to hold me here against my will.

dlga_start:lady_talk_refugee|{playername} -- I assume that you, as a {man/lady} of honor, will accord gentle-born ladies such as ourselves the right to return to our families, and not demand a ransom.
dlga_start:close_window.20|Well, {playername} -- you fought a duel with {s10}, and lost. According to our custom and tradition, I should no longer receive you. Farewell, {playername}.
dlga_lady_talk_refugee:close_window|Of course, my lady
dlga_lady_talk_refugee:lady_captive_talk|You assume wrong, my lady!
dlga_lady_captive_talk:lady_captive_confirm|What?! What infamy is this?
dlga_lady_captive_confirm:close_window|My apologies - you must have misunderstood me. Of course you may leave.
dlga_lady_captive_confirm:close_window.1|Contact your family to arrange for a ransom, my lady.
dlga_kingdom_lady_captive:close_window|Then write to your family, and ask them to hurry up with the ransom!
dlga_kingdom_lady_captive:close_window.1|I have changed my mind -- you are free to go
dlga_start:close_window.21|Ah, {playername}. How good it is to see you again. However, I believe that I am required elsewhere.
dlga_start:lady_duel_lost|Oh {playername} -- I heard of your duel with {s10}. I wish now that you had never fought him, for our honor and tradition demand that, having lost to him, you now break off your suit with me. Farewell, {playername}.
dlga_lady_duel_lost:close_window|Very well - we must do as tradition demands... Farewell, my lady
dlga_lady_duel_lost:lady_duel_lost_flaunt_conventions|Let honor and tradition hang!
dlga_lady_duel_lost_flaunt_conventions:close_window|Oh, {playername}! Although people will talk, it would so break my heart to no longer be able to see you. We shall ignore this silly, cruel tradition.
dlga_lady_duel_lost_flaunt_conventions:close_window.1|No, {playername} -- I cannot afford to fritter away my good name, and neither can you.
dlga_start:lady_start|Oh, {playername} -- I have heard that you won your duel with {s10}. I'm grateful that you have delivered me from that man's attentions!
dlga_start:lady_start.1|Well, {playername} --  you won your duel with {s10}. Clearly, he was not worthy of my affections.
dlga_lady_duel_rep_1:lady_start|Well, {playername} --  you won your duel with {s10}. Oh, such foolishness, that men should fight over me! Sigh... But it is a bit romantic, I suppose.
dlga_lady_duel_rep_2:lady_start|Well, {playername} --  you won your duel with {s10}. Honor now demands that he and I no longer meet... I was fond of him, you know. You did me no service by fighting him, sir.
dlga_start:lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_1|My dear {playername}, how joyous to see you again! I heard you gave that vile {s13} a well-deserved lesson. I hope he never forgets his humiliation. I've a reward for you, but I fear it's little compared to what you've done for me.
dlga_lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_1:lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_2|Oh, it will just have to do.
dlga_lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_1:lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_2.1|{s66}, this is far too much!
dlga_lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_1:lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_2.2|Please, {s65}, no reward is necessary.
dlga_lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_2:lady_pretalk|{s10}
dlga_start:lady_qst_duel_for_lady_failed|I was told that you sought satisfaction from {s13} to prove my innocence, {playername}. It was a fine gesture, and I thank you for your efforts.
dlga_lady_qst_duel_for_lady_failed:lady_qst_duel_for_lady_failed_2|I beg your forgiveness for my defeat, {s65}...
dlga_lady_qst_duel_for_lady_failed_2:lady_pretalk|It matters not, dear {playername}. You tried. The truth cannot be proven at the point of a sword, but you willingly put your life at stake for my honour. That alone will convince many of my innocence.
dlga_start:lady_escort_lady_succeeded|Thank you for escorting me here, {playername}. Please accept this gift as a token of my gratitude. I hope we shall meet again sometime in the future.
dlga_lady_escort_lady_succeeded:close_window|It was an honor to serve you, {s65}.
dlga_start:lady_start.2|Ah {playername} - you must have received my message. How happy I am that you could come!
dlga_start:lady_proposal_pending|{playername} - is there any word from my family?
dlga_start:lady_betrothed|I hear that my {s11} has refused your request to marry me. Does that mean that we must part?

dlga_start:rescue_prisoner_succeed_1|Oh, {playername}, you brought him back to me! Thank you ever so much for rescuing my {s11}. Please, take this as some small repayment for your noble deed.
dlga_rescue_prisoner_succeed_1:lady_pretalk|Always an honour to serve, {s65}.
dlga_start:lady_meet_end|You must be {playername}. We have just had the honor of watching you distinguish yourself in the recent tournament{s8}.
dlga_start:lady_meet_end.1|You must be {playername}. My {s15} {s16} has spoken most highly of you. I am delighted to make your acquaintance.
dlga_start:lady_premeet|I say, you don't look familiar...
dlga_start:close_window.22|There! I can see the walls of {s3} in the distance. We've made it safely. Here, take this purse of {reg3} crowns, as I promised. I hope we can travel together again someday.
dlga_start:lady_start.3|{playername} -- how good it is to see you. (Whispers:) I still remember your visits fondly.
dlga_start:lady_meet_end.2|Ah, {playername}. How splendid it was to see you distinguish yourself in the recent tournament.
dlga_start:lady_start.4|{s12}
dlga_lady_start:lady_betrothed|I have sad news. I have become betrothed to {s5} -- against my will, I should say! Oh {playername} - I would so much rather be wed to you!
dlga_lady_start:lady_betrothed.1|Good {playername} -- I have become betrothed to {s5}. It is now no longer seemly for us to see each other like this.
dlga_lady_start:lady_other_suitor|I must tell you -- there is another lord who has been paying me attentions, although I cannot abide him. I fear he has designs on me, and may try to force me to wed against my will.
dlga_lady_start:lady_talk|{s11}It is probably not suitable for us to tarry too long here in conversation, but I would hope to see you again soon.
dlga_lady_start:lady_talk.1|{s11}
dlga_lady_start:lady_talk.2|I was planning to retire for a little while, but perhaps we may have a chance to speak more later...
dlga_lady_start:lady_talk.3|It is so delightful to have a chance to spend some time together.{s12}

dlga_lady_proposal_pending_end:close_window|{s11}

dlga_lady_betrothed:lady_pretalk|Perhaps I may still be able to change your {s11}'s mind
dlga_lady_betrothed:lady_conclude_relationship|So be it -- let us then part
dlga_lady_suggest_elope:lady_conclude_relationship|Good {playername} -- you are a good and kind man, but a lady cannot defy her family. Such things are not done!
dlga_lady_suggest_elope:lady_other_suitor|Sir -- as you may know, I have been entertaining offers from a number of gentlemen such as yourself. I am not yet at a stage where I can commit to any of them.
dlga_lady_suggest_elope:lady_conclude_relationship.1|Ah {playername}, you must realize. You are still finding your way in the world. I have great affection for you, {playername}, but I will not consign myself to obscurity.
dlga_lady_suggest_elope:lady_conclude_relationship.2|Ah {playername}, although you are kind to me, I am not certain enough of your morals to risk such a thing. Although I bare little affection for my husband, it would be a weighty thing to go against my family's wishes, and I am not certain enough of you to take that step.
dlga_lady_suggest_elope:lady_conclude_relationship.3|Good {playername} -- to elope would be to throw away my ties with my family, which are everything to me! I have a considerable affection for you, but I am not sure that I am prepared to risk that.
dlga_lady_suggest_elope:lady_conclude_relationship.4|Good {playername} -- I am not used to the hardships of campaigning as you are. I want a home to call my own. If you were lord of a castle or town with a great hall, I would gladly go there as your wife, to be mistress of the household. But I do not wish to live like a hunted animal.
dlga_lady_suggest_elope:lady_elope_agree|Elope with you? Yes -- we could do that. It is a great step to defy my family -- but a loveless marriage, and life without you, might be a far worse thing! But be warned -- this will be a terrible blow to my {s11}'s prestige, and he will do everything in his power to bring you down.
dlga_lady_elope_agree:lady_elope_agree_nurse|Quickly, then! There is no time to lose.
dlga_lady_elope_agree:close_window|Everything in his power, you say? Em... Let me think about this...
dlga_lady_elope_agree_nurse:lady_elope_agree_lady_vows|Your lordship... Your ladyship... Would you like me to witness your exchange of vows?
dlga_lady_elope_agree_lady_vows:lady_elope_agree_nurse_2|Yes, do that. For my part, I make the following vow: I, {s4}, do swear that I accept {playername} as my husband, according to the ancient law and custom of our land...
dlga_lady_elope_agree_nurse_2:lady_elope_agree_player_vows|Very good. Do you, {playername}, swear similarly to accept {s4} as your wife?
dlga_lady_elope_agree_player_vows:close_window|I do.
dlga_lady_elope_agree_player_vows:close_window.1|Eh, what? This is all moving too fast...
dlga_lady_elope_agree:lady_conclude_relationship|Oh, really? My dear -- I could never separate a lady from her family like that...
dlga_lady_conclude_relationship:lady_conclude_relationship_confirm|So I suppose our time together must come to an end...
dlga_lady_conclude_relationship_confirm:lady_conclude_relationship_confirm_yes|Yes -- it must be...
dlga_lady_conclude_relationship_confirm:lady_conclude_relationship_confirm_no|Wait -- perhaps there is still a chance for us!
dlga_lady_conclude_relationship_confirm_yes:close_window|Farewell, {playername}. We will see each other, in the courts and castles of this realm, but we must keep our distance from each other. I will remember these days fondly, nonetheless.
dlga_lady_conclude_relationship_confirm_no:close_window|In that case, we shall see what the future brings.
dlga_lady_generic_mission_succeeded:lady_pretalk|Always an honour to serve, {s65}.
dlga_lady_premeet:lady_meet|I am {playername}.
dlga_lady_premeet:lady_meet.1|My name is {playername}. At your service.
dlga_lady_meet:lady_meet_end|Of course. How splendid to finally make your acquaintance.
dlga_lady_meet:lady_meet_end.1|{playername}? I do not believe I've heard of you before.
dlga_lady_meet_end:lady_talk|I am about to retire for a little while, but perhaps we may have a chance to speak more later...
dlga_lady_meet_end:lady_talk.1|Now, if you will excuse me...
dlga_lady_meet_end:lady_talk.2|Can I help you with anything?
dlga_lady_talk:lord_talk_ask_location|I want to know the location of someone.
dlga_lady_pretalk:lady_talk|Now, if you will excuse me...
dlga_lady_pretalk:lady_talk.1|Is there anything else?
dlga_lady_talk:lady_relations|May I have the honor of knowing more about you, my lady?
dlga_lady_relations:lady_pretalk|{s12}
dlga_lady_talk:lady_profess_admiration|My lady, I would like to profess myself your most ardent admirer
dlga_lady_talk:lady_tournament_dedication_reaction|My lady, I would like to dedicate my successes in this recent tournament to you
dlga_lady_tournament_dedication_reaction:lady_pretalk|{s9}
dlga_lady_profess_admiration:close_window|{s11}I would like it very much if we could see more of each other.
dlga_lady_profess_admiration:lady_pretalk|Ah... You are too kind... My, the hour is getting rather late, isn't it? I really must be going.
dlga_lady_talk:lady_recite_poetry|Do you like poetry, my lady?
dlga_lady_recite_poetry:lady_recite_poetry|That would depend on the poem. Did you intend to recite a verse?
dlga_lady_recite_poetry:lady_recite_poetry_response|The wind that blows the dry steppe dust...

dlga_lady_recite_poetry:lady_recite_poetry_response.4|I deflected her skeptical questioning darts/with armor made of purest devotion...
dlga_lady_recite_poetry:lady_pretalk|Actually, I can't think of any that I would care to recite...
dlga_lady_recite_poetry_response:lady_private_conversation_end|{s11}
dlga_lady_private_conversation_end:lady_pretalk|Time is passing quickly, and we cannot linger here too long.
dlga_lady_talk:lady_marriage_discussion|Do you think that we may have a future together, my lady?
dlga_lady_marriage_discussion:lady_other_suitor|Sir -- as you may know, I have been entertaining offers from a number of gentlemen such as yourself. I am not yet at a stage where I can commit to any of them.
dlga_lady_marriage_discussion:lady_proposal_refused|It is good to hear that you are thinking seriously about the future. However, I would like to see you rise a little further in the world before I am ready to commit to marry you.
dlga_lady_marriage_discussion:lady_proposal_refused.1|It is good to hear that your intentions are honorable. However, I have resolved only to marry a man of the strongest moral fiber. I would like you to prove yourself more in that regard.
dlga_lady_marriage_discussion:lady_proposal_refused.2|Sir -- it is comforting to hear that your intentions towards me are honorable. But perhaps we should take the time to get to allow our affections for each other to grow a little stronger, before making any such decision.
dlga_lady_marriage_discussion:lady_betrothed|Oh {playername}, how happy that would make me! But my {s11} {s4} would never allow it... Perhaps it is best that we part...
dlga_lady_marriage_discussion:close_window|Oh {playername}, how happy that would make me! Go ask my {s11} {s4} for permission!
dlga_lady_proposal_refused:lady_proposal_refused_persuade_check|Perhaps I can persuade you to delay no further.
dlga_lady_proposal_refused_persuade_check:lady_proposal_refused_persuade_player_response|What do you have to say?
dlga_lady_proposal_refused_persuade_player_response:lady_proposal_refused_persuade_result|Love is as a rose, my lady. Left unplucked, it may wither.
dlga_lady_proposal_refused_persuade_player_response:lady_pretalk|Oh, never mind.
dlga_lady_proposal_refused_persuade_result:close_window|Enough, sir! I shall not be rushed into marriage, with you or with anyone else! You have made me very cross. Please, leave me alone for a while. I shall let you know when I am ready to speak to you again.
dlga_lady_proposal_refused_persuade_result:lady_betrothed|Oh {playername}, I could never allow that to happen! Oh, if only we could be wed! But my {s11} {s4} would never give his permission... Perhaps it is best that we part...
dlga_lady_proposal_refused_persuade_result:close_window.1|Oh {playername}, I could never allow that to happen! Go ask my {s11} {s4} his permission for us to be wed!
dlga_lady_proposal_refused:close_window|Very well -- I shall continue to strive to be worthy of your esteem!
dlga_lady_proposal_refused:lady_player_threatens_compel|I am tired of these games! I will speak to your family about arranging a wedding immediately..
dlga_lady_player_threatens_compel:lady_player_threatens_compel_2|What? Do you mean that?
dlga_lady_player_threatens_compel_2:lady_private_conversation_end|No, of couse not. Please forgive my burst of temper
dlga_lady_player_threatens_compel_2:close_window|Yes -- you clearly do not know what is in your best interests.
dlga_lady_other_suitor:lady_pretalk|It grieves me to hear that, my lady, but such things must be
dlga_lady_other_suitor:lady_other_suitor_challenge|Who is the miscreant! Tell me his name!
dlga_lady_other_suitor:lady_player_threatens_compel|I am tired of these games! I will demand that your family compel you to marry me..
dlga_lady_other_suitor_challenge:lady_pretalk|I would be so grateful! But from what I understand, you already have a duel on your hands. He is not honor-bound to fight you, if you are committed to another combat. Please, conclude your other business in a hurry, to rescue me from that man's attentions!.
dlga_lady_other_suitor_challenge:lady_pretalk.1|Ah! Such talk. But from what I hear, you already have a duel on your hands. Finish one before you start another! Sigh... You men can be so silly...
dlga_lady_other_suitor_challenge:lady_other_suitor_challenge_confirm|It is {s5}. Please, rescue me from that man's attentions!
dlga_lady_other_suitor_challenge:lady_other_suitor_challenge_confirm.1|Will you now? This should be interesting. Very well. Your rival is {s5}. Let us see which of you has the greater mettle.
dlga_lady_other_suitor_challenge:lady_other_suitor_challenge_confirm.2|Oh, fie! I wish that this were not a matter of honor, so I could refuse such a request. But alas, I feel compelled to tell you that your rival is {s5}. I wish that heaven had not granted me such a fair visage, so that I would not inspire such passions in men!
dlga_lady_other_suitor_challenge:lady_other_suitor_challenge_confirm.3|I will have none of such talk! It is nonsense for you and {s5} to fight over -- whoops! I beg of you, sir, forget the name that just escaped my lips...
dlga_lady_other_suitor_challenge_confirm:lady_other_suitor_challenge_confirm_yes|So be it! I shall challenge him to a trial of arms!
dlga_lady_other_suitor_challenge_confirm:lady_other_suitor_challenge_confirm_no|On second thought, I let my passions run away with me there. Never mind.
dlga_lady_other_suitor_challenge_confirm_yes:lady_pretalk|{s15}
dlga_lady_other_suitor_challenge_confirm_no:lady_private_conversation_end|Good. You are wise not to let your temper guide you.
dlga_lady_talk:lady_ask_for_quest|Is there anything I can do to win your favour?
dlga_lady_ask_for_quest:lady_pretalk|I don't have anything else for you to do right now.
dlga_lady_ask_for_quest:lady_mission_told|Oh, I fear I may never see my {s17}, {s13}, again... He is a prisoner in the dungeon of {s14}. We have tried to negotiate his ransom, but it has been set too high. We can never hope to raise that much money without selling everything we own, and God knows {s13} would rather spend his life in prison than make us destitute. Instead I came up with a plan to get him out of there, but it requires someone to make a great sacrifice, and so far my pleas have fallen on deaf ears...
dlga_lady_ask_for_quest:lady_mission_told.1|My poor {s11}, {s13}, is a prisoner in the {s14} dungeons. The only way we can talk to each other is by exchanging letters whenever we can, but the journey is so dangerous that we get little chance to do so. Please, would you deliver one for me?
dlga_lady_ask_for_quest:lady_quest_duel_for_lady|Dear {playername}, you are kind to ask, but you know little of my troubles and I can't possibly ask you to throw yourself into danger on my behalf.
dlga_lady_quest_duel_for_lady:lady_quest_duel_for_lady_2|Tell me what the problem is, and I can make my own decision.
dlga_lady_quest_duel_for_lady_2:lady_quest_duel_for_lady_3|Very well, as you wish it... My husband has made certain enemies in his life, {playername}. One of the most insidious is {s13}. He is going around making terrible accusations against me, impugning my honour at every turn! Because he cannot harm my husband directly, he is using me as a target to try and stain our name. You should hear the awful things he's said! I only wish there was someone brave enough to make him recant his slander, but {s13} is a very fine swordsman, and he's widely feared...
dlga_lady_quest_duel_for_lady_3:lady_quest_duel_for_lady_3_accepted|I fear him not, {s65}. I will make him take back his lies.
dlga_lady_quest_duel_for_lady_3_accepted:close_window|Oh! I can't ask that of you, {playername}, but... I would be forever indebted to you, and you are so sure. It would mean so much if you would defend my honour. Thank you a thousand times, all my prayers and my favour go with you.
dlga_lady_quest_duel_for_lady_3:lady_quest_duel_for_lady_3_rejected|If he's that dangerous, perhaps maybe it would be better to ignore him...
dlga_lady_quest_duel_for_lady_3_rejected:close_window|Oh... Perhaps you're right, {playername}. I should let go of these silly childhood ideas of chivalry and courage. {Men/People} are not like that, not anymore. Good day to you.
dlga_lady_ask_for_quest:lady_pretalk.1|No, {playername}, I've no need for a champion right now.
dlga_lady_mission_told:lady_mission_accepted|As you wish it, {s65}, it shall be done.
dlga_lady_mission_told:lady_mission_rejected|{s66}, I fear I cannot help you right now.
dlga_lady_mission_accepted:close_window|You are a true {gentleman/lady}, {playername}. Thank you so much for helping me
dlga_lady_mission_rejected:close_window|You'll not help a woman in need? You should be ashamed, {playername}... Please leave me, I have some important embroidery to catch up.
dlga_lady_talk:lady_restore_relation|I want to improve my relation with a lord. Can you help me?
dlga_lady_restore_relation:lady_pretalk|{playername}, I don't know you well enough to act on your behalf. I am sorry.
dlga_lady_restore_relation:lady_restore_relation_2|Hmm. I guess you got on the wrong side of somebody. Very well, who do you want to restore your relation with?
dlga_lady_restore_relation_2:lady_restore_relation_2b|{s1}
dlga_lady_restore_relation_2:lady_pretalk|Never mind. I get along with everyone well enough.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_2b:lady_restore_relation_3|Well I can try to help you there. I am sure a few expensive gifts will make {s10} look at you more favorably.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_3:lady_restore_relation_4|You can improve your relation with {s10} by sending {reg4?her:him} a gift worth {reg10} crowns. But if you can afford spending {reg11} crowns on the gift, it would make a good impression on {reg4?her:him}. And if you can go up to {reg12} crowns, that would really help smooth things out.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_4:lady_restore_relation_5|I think a gift of {reg10} crowns will do.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_4:lady_restore_relation_5.1|Maybe I can afford {reg11} crowns.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_4:lady_restore_relation_5.2|In that case, I am ready to spend {reg12} crowns.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_4:lady_restore_relation_cant_afford|I don't think I can afford a gift at the moment.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_5:lady_restore_relation_6|Excellent. Then I'll choose an appropriate gift for you and send it to {s10} with your compliments. I am sure {reg4?she:he} will appreciate the gesture.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_6:lady_pretalk|Thank you for your help, madame.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_cant_afford:lady_pretalk|I am afraid, I can't be of much help in that case, {playername}. I am sorry.
dlga_lady_talk:lady_leave|I must beg my leave.
dlga_lady_leave:close_window|{s12}
dlga_convince_begin:convince_options|I still don't see why I should accept what you're asking of me.
dlga_convince_options:convince_bribe|Then I'll make it worth your while. ({reg8} crowns)
dlga_convince_options:convince_friendship|Please, do it for the sake of our friendship. (-{reg9} to relation)
dlga_convince_options:convince_persuade_begin|Let me try and convince you. (Persuasion)
dlga_convince_options:lord_pretalk|Never mind.
dlga_convince_bribe:convince_bribe_verify|Mmm, a generous gift to my coffers would certainly help matters... {reg8} crowns should do it. If you agree, then I'll go with your suggestion.
dlga_convince_bribe_verify:convince_bribe_cant_afford|I'm afraid my finances will not allow for such a gift.
dlga_convince_bribe_verify:convince_bribe_goon|Very well, please accept these {reg8} crowns as a token of my gratitude.
dlga_convince_bribe_verify:convince_begin|Let me think about this some more.
dlga_convince_bribe_cant_afford:convince_options|Ah. In that case, there is little I can do, unless you have some further argument to make.
dlga_convince_bribe_goon:convince_accept|My dear {playername}, your generous gift has led me to reconsider what you ask, and I have come to appreciate the wisdom of your proposal.
dlga_convince_friendship:convince_friendship_verify|You've done well by me in the past, {playername}, and for that I will go along with your request, but know that I do not like you using our relationship this way.
dlga_convince_friendship_verify:convince_friendship_go_on|I am sorry, my friend, but I need your help in this.
dlga_convince_friendship_verify:lord_pretalk|If it will not please you, then I'll try something else.
dlga_convince_friendship_go_on:convince_accept|All right then, {playername}, I will accept this for your sake. But remember, you owe me for this.
dlga_convince_friendship:lord_pretalk|I don't think I owe you such a favor {playername}. I see no reason to accept this for you.
dlga_convince_friendship:lord_pretalk.1|Is this a joke? You've some nerve asking me for favours, {playername}, and let me assure you you'll get none.
dlga_convince_persuade_begin:convince_persuade_begin_2|Very well. Make your case.
dlga_convince_persuade_begin_2:convince_persuade|[Attempt to persuade]
dlga_convince_persuade_begin_2:convince_begin|Wait, perhaps there is another way to convince you.
dlga_convince_persuade_begin:lord_pretalk|By God's grace, {playername}! Haven't we talked enough already? I am tired of listening to you, and I do not want to hear any more of it right now.
dlga_convince_persuade:convince_accept|All right, all right. You have persuaded me to it. I'll go ahead with what you suggest.
dlga_convince_persuade:convince_options|You've a point, {playername}, I'll admit that much. However I am not yet convinced I should do as you bid.
dlga_convince_persuade:convince_options.1|Enough, {playername}. You've a lot of arguments, but I find none of them truly convincing. I stand by what I said before.
dlga_convince_persuade:convince_options.2|Truthfully, {playername}, I fail to see the virtue of your reasoning. What you ask for makes even less sense now than it did before.
dlga_start:siege_won_seneschal_1|I must congratulate you on your victory, my {lord/lady}. Welcome to {s1}. We, the housekeepers of this castle, are at your service.
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_1:siege_won_seneschal_2|Are you the seneschal?
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_2:siege_won_seneschal_3|Indeed I am, my {lord/lady}. I have always served the masters of {s1} to the best of my ability, whichever side they might be on. Thus you may count on my utmost loyalty for as long as you are the {lord/lady} of this place. Now, do you intend to keep me on as the seneschal? I promise you will not be disappointed.
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_3:siege_won_seneschal_4|Very well, you may keep your post for the time being.
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_3:siege_won_seneschal_4.1|You can stay, but I shall be keeping a close watch on you.
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_4:siege_won_seneschal_5|Thank you, my {lord/lady}. If you do not mind my impudence, may I inquire as to what you wish to do with the castle?
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_5:siege_won_seneschal_6|I will sell it to another lord.
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_5:siege_won_seneschal_6.1|I intend to claim it for myself.
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_5:siege_won_seneschal_list_options|I haven't given it much thought. What are my options?
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_list_options:siege_won_seneschal_list_options_2|According to our laws and traditions, you can do one of several things. First, you could station a garrison here to protect the castle from any immediate counterattacks, then request an audience with some wealthy lord and ask him to make you an offer. It would be worth a tidy sum, believe you me. If you do not wish to sell, then you will have to find yourself a liege lord and protector who would accept homage from you. Without a royal investiture and an army at your back, you would have a difficult time holding on to the castle. Both you and {s1} would become great big targets for any man with a few soldiers and a scrap of ambition. 
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_list_options_2:siege_won_seneschal_list_options_3|What do you mean, a liege lord and protector? I won this place by my own hand, I don't need anyone else!
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_list_options_3:siege_won_seneschal_list_options_4|Of course you don't, my {lord/lady}. However, no lord in the land will recognize your claim to the castle unless it is verified by royal decree. They would call {s1} an outlaw stronghold and take it from you at the earliest opportunity. Surely not even you could stand against a whole army.
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_list_options_4:siege_won_seneschal_6|Hmm. I'll give it some thought.
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_6:close_window|I am very pleased to hear it, my {lord/lady}. I am only trying to serve you to the best of my ability. Now, if at any time you find you have further need of me, I will be in the great hall arranging a smooth handover of the castle to your forces. 
dlga_start:seneschal_intro_1|Good day, {sir/madam}. I do nott believe I've seen you here before. Let me extend my welcome to you as the seneschal of {s1}.
dlga_seneschal_intro_1:seneschal_intro_1a|A pleasure to meet you, {s65}.
dlga_seneschal_intro_1a:seneschal_talk|How can I help you?
dlga_seneschal_intro_1:seneschal_intro_1b|What exactly do you do here?
dlga_seneschal_intro_1b:seneschal_talk|Ah, a seneschal's duties are many, good {sire/woman}. For example, I collect the rents from my lord's estates, I manage the castle's storerooms, I deal with the local peasantry, I take care of castle staff, I arrange supplies for the garrison... All mundane matters on this fief are my responsibility, on behalf of my lord. Everything except commanding the soldiers themselves.
dlga_start:seneschal_talk|Good day, {sir/madam}.
dlga_seneschal_pretalk:seneschal_talk|Anything else?

dlga_seneschal_ask_something_2:seneschal_ask_location|Perhaps you know where to find someone...
dlga_seneschal_ask_location:seneschal_ask_location_2|Well, a man in my position does hear a lot of things. Of whom were you thinking?

dlga_start:merchant_talk.2|What do you want? We are but simple merchants, we've no quarrel with you, so leave us alone.

dlga_caravan_start_war_quest_2:merchant_attack|We'll see about that! Defend yourselves!
dlga_caravan_start_war_quest_2:close_window|Hmm. Maybe this was all a misunderstanding. Farewell.
dlga_merchant_talk:merchant_talk_offer|I have an offer for you.
dlga_merchant_talk_offer:merchant_talk_offer_2|What is it?
dlga_merchant_talk_offer_2:caravan_offer_protection|I can escort you to your destination for a price.

dlga_merchant_demand_toll:merchant_demand_toll_2|Please, I don't want any trouble. I can give you {reg6} crowns, just let us go.
dlga_merchant_demand_toll:merchant_demand_toll_2.1|I don't want any trouble. I can give you {reg6} crowns if you'll let us go.
dlga_merchant_demand_toll_2:merchant_demand_toll_accept|Agreed, hand it over and you may go in peace.
dlga_merchant_demand_toll_accept:close_window|Very well then. Here's {reg6} crowns. 
dlga_merchant_demand_toll_2:merchant_pretalk|I changed my mind, I can't take your money.
dlga_merchant_demand_toll_2:merchant_attack|No, I want everything you have! [Attack]
dlga_merchant_demand_2:merchant_attack_begin|Hand over your gold and valuables now!
dlga_merchant_demand_2:merchant_pretalk|Nothing. Forget it.
dlga_merchant_attack_begin:merchant_attack_verify|Are you robbing us?{s11}
dlga_merchant_attack_verify:merchant_attack_verify_norob|Robbing you? No, no! It was a joke.
dlga_merchant_attack_verify_norob:close_window|God, don't joke about that, {lad/lass}. For a moment I thought we were in real trouble.
dlga_merchant_attack_verify:merchant_attack|Of course I'm robbing you. Now hand over your goods.
dlga_merchant_attack:close_window|Damn you, you won't get anything from us without a fight!
dlga_caravan_offer_protection:caravan_offer_protection_2|These roads are dangerous indeed. One can never have enough protection.
dlga_caravan_offer_protection_2:close_window|An escort? We're almost there already! Thank you for the offer, though.
dlga_caravan_offer_protection_2:caravan_offer_protection_3|We are heading to {s1}. I will pay you {reg2} crowns if you escort us there.
dlga_caravan_offer_protection_3:caravan_offer_protection_4|Agreed.
dlga_caravan_offer_protection_4:caravan_offer_protection_5|I want you to stay close to us along the way. We'll need your help if we get ambushed by bandits.
dlga_caravan_offer_protection_5:caravan_offer_protection_6|Don't worry, you can trust me.
dlga_caravan_offer_protection_6:close_window|Good. Come and collect your money when we're within sight of {s1}. For now, let's just get underway.
dlga_caravan_offer_protection_3:caravan_offer_protection_4b|Forget it.
dlga_caravan_offer_protection_4b:close_window|Perhaps another time, then.
dlga_merchant_talk:talk_caravan_enemy_2|Not so fast. First, hand over all your goods and money.
dlga_talk_caravan_enemy_2:close_window|Never. It is our duty to protect these goods. You shall have to fight us, brigand!
dlga_merchant_talk:close_window|[Leave]
dlga_merchant_talk:merchant_vend_caravaane|Do you have anything interesting to sell in your cargo?
dlga_merchant_vend_caravaane:merchant_pretalk|Look, and quickly please... because of brigands.
dlga_start:prison_guard_players|Good day, my {lord/lady}. Will you be visiting the prison?
dlga_prison_guard_players:close_window|Yes. Unlock the door.
dlga_prison_guard_players:close_window.1|No, not now.
dlga_start:prison_guard_talk|Yes? What do you want?
dlga_prison_guard_talk:prison_guard_ask_prisoners|Who is imprisoned here?
dlga_prison_guard_talk:prison_guard_visit_prison|I want to speak with a prisoner.
dlga_prison_guard_ask_prisoners:prison_guard_talk|Currently, {s50} {reg1?are:is} imprisoned here.{s49}
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison:close_window|Of course, {sir/madam}. Go in.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison:prison_guard_visit_prison_2|You need to get permission from the lord to talk to prisoners.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison:prison_guard_visit_prison_nobody|There is nobody inside, therefore you can freely go inside and look around.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_nobody:close_window|All right then. I'll take a look at the prison.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_nobody:close_window.1|I have more important business to do.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_2:close_window|All right then. I'll try that.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_2:prison_guard_visit_prison_3|Come on now. I thought you were the boss here.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_3:prison_guard_visit_prison_4|He-heh. You got that right. Still, I can't let you into the prison.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_4:close_window|All right then. I'll leave now.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_4:prison_guard_visit_prison_5|I found a purse with 100 crowns a few paces away. I reckon it belongs to you.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_5:close_window|Ah! I was looking for this all day. How good of you to bring it back {sir/madam}. Well, now that I know what an honest {man/lady} you are, there can be no harm in letting you inside for a look. Go in.... Just so you know, though -- I'll be hanging onto the keys, in case you were thinking about undoing anyone's chains.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_4:prison_guard_visit_break|Give me the keys to the cells -- now!
dlga_prison_guard_visit_break:close_window|Help! Help! Prison break!
dlga_prison_guard_talk:close_window|Never mind.
dlga_start:castle_guard_players|Your orders, {Lord/Lady}?
dlga_castle_guard_players:close_window|Open the door. I'll go in.
dlga_castle_guard_players:close_window.1|Never mind.
dlga_start:castle_guard_sneaked_intro_1|Get out of my sight, beggar! You stink!
dlga_start:close_window.24|You have come just in time. Let us join our forces now and teach our enemy a lesson.
dlga_castle_guard_sneaked_intro_1:castle_guard_sneaked_intro_2|I want to enter the hall and speak to the lord.
dlga_castle_guard_sneaked_intro_1:close_window|[Leave]
dlga_castle_guard_sneaked_intro_2:close_window|Are you out of your mind, {man/woman}? Beggars are not allowed into the hall. Now get lost or I'll beat you bloody.
dlga_start:castle_guard_intro_1|What do you want?
dlga_castle_guard_intro_1:castle_guard_intro_2|I want to enter the hall and speak to the lord.
dlga_castle_guard_intro_1:close_window|Never mind.
dlga_castle_guard_intro_2:close_window|I'm afraid there is a feast in progress, and you are not invited.
dlga_castle_guard_intro_2:castle_guard_intro_3|You can go in after leaving your weapons with me. No one is allowed to carry arms into the lord's hall.
dlga_castle_guard_intro_3:close_window|Here, take my arms. I'll go in.
dlga_castle_guard_intro_3:castle_guard_intro_2b|No, I give my arms to no one.
dlga_castle_guard_intro_2b:close_window|Then you can't go in.
dlga_start:castle_gate_guard_talk|What do you want?
dlga_castle_gate_guard_pretalk:castle_gate_guard_talk|Yes?
dlga_castle_gate_guard_talk:castle_gate_open|We need shelter for the night. Will you let us in?
dlga_castle_gate_guard_talk:request_meeting_castle_lord|I want to speak with the lord of the castle.
dlga_castle_gate_guard_talk:request_meeting_other|I want to speak with someone in the castle.
dlga_castle_gate_guard_talk:close_window|[Leave]
dlga_request_meeting_castle_lord:close_window|Wait here. {s2} will see you.
dlga_request_meeting_castle_lord:castle_gate_guard_pretalk|My lord is not here now.
dlga_request_meeting_other:request_meeting_3|Who is that?
dlga_request_meeting_3:request_meeting_4|{s3}
dlga_request_meeting_3:close_window|Never mind.
dlga_request_meeting_4:request_meeting_5|Wait there. I'll send him your request.
dlga_request_meeting_5:request_meeting_6|I'm waiting...
dlga_request_meeting_6:close_window|All right. {s2} will talk to you now.
dlga_request_meeting_6:close_window.1|{s2} says he will not see you. Begone now.
dlga_castle_gate_open:close_window|My lord {s2} will be happy to see you {sir/madam}. Come on in. I am opening the gates for you.
dlga_castle_gate_open:close_window.1|My lord {s2} is not in the castle now. But I think he would approve of you taking shelter here. Come on in. I am opening the gates for you.
dlga_castle_gate_open:close_window.2|Come on in. I am opening the gates for you.
dlga_castle_gate_open:close_window.3|Come on in. But make sure your men behave sensibly within the walls. My lord {s2} does not want trouble here.
dlga_castle_gate_open:close_window.4|My lord {s2} does not want you here. Begone now.
dlga_start:close_window.25|You are making a big mistake by fighting against us.
dlga_start:close_window.26|Again you save our necks, {playername}! Truly, you are the best of friends. {s43}
dlga_start:ally_thanks_meet|I don't think we have met properly my friend. You just saved my life out there, and I still don't know your name...
dlga_start:ally_thanks_meet.1|Your help was most welcome stranger. My name is {s1}. Can I learn yours?
dlga_start:ally_thanks_meet.2|Thanks for your help, stranger. We haven't met properly yet, have we? What is your name?
dlga_ally_thanks_meet:ally_thanks_meet_2|My name is {playername}.
dlga_ally_thanks_meet_2:close_window|Well met indeed {playername}. My name is {s1} and I am forever in your debt. If there is ever anything I can help you with, just let me know...
dlga_ally_thanks_meet_2:close_window.1|Well met {playername}. I am in your debt for what you just did. I hope one day I will find a way to repay it.
dlga_ally_thanks_meet_2:close_window.2|Well met {playername}. I am {s1}. Thanks for your help and I hope we meet again.
dlga_start:close_window.27|You arrived just in the nick of time! {playername}. You have my deepest thanks! {s43}
dlga_start:close_window.28|You turned up just in time, {playername}. I will not forget your help. {s43}

dlga_start:close_window.30|{s43}
dlga_start:close_window.31|{s43}
dlga_start:close_window.32|Thank you for your help {sir/madam}. You saved {reg1?our lives:my life} out there.
dlga_start:close_window.33|Thank you for your help {sir/madam}. Things didn't look very well for us but then you came up and everything changed.
dlga_start:close_window.34|Thank you for your help, {sir/madam}. It was fortunate to have you nearby.
dlga_start:kidnapped_girl_liberated_battle|Oh {sir/madam}. Thank you so much for rescuing me. Will you take me to my family now?
dlga_start:freed_hero_answer|I am in your debt for freeing me friend.
dlga_freed_hero_answer:freed_hero_answer_1|You're not going anywhere. You'll be my prisoner now!
dlga_freed_hero_answer_1:close_window|Alas. Will my luck never change?
dlga_freed_hero_answer:freed_hero_answer_2|You're free to go, {s65}.
dlga_freed_hero_answer_2:close_window|Thank you, good {sire/lady}. I never forget someone who's done me a good turn.
dlga_freed_hero_answer:freed_hero_answer_3|Would you like to join me?
dlga_freed_hero_answer_3:close_window|All right I will join you.
dlga_freed_hero_answer_3:close_window.1|No, I want to go on my own.
dlga_start:defeat_hero_answer|You'll not live long to enjoy your victory. My kinsmen will soon wipe out the stain of this defeat.
dlga_defeat_hero_answer:defeat_hero_answer_1|You are my prisoner now.
dlga_defeat_hero_answer_1:close_window|Damn you. You will regret this.
dlga_defeat_hero_answer:defeat_hero_answer_2|You're free to go this time, but don't cross my path again.
dlga_defeat_hero_answer_2:close_window|We will meet again.
dlga_combined_political_quests:political_quest_suggested|{s9}
dlga_political_quest_follow_on:close_window|I think that is a wise move. Good luck to you.
dlga_combined_political_quests:political_quest_suggested.1|Your relations with {s4} are not all that they could be. As {reg4?she:he} is my {s11}, I can mediate to attempt to mend your quarrel. Perhaps the best way for me to do this would be to send {reg4?her:him} a gift -- a fur-trimmed velvet robe, perhaps. If you can provide me with a bolt of velvet and a length of furs, I can have one made and sent to {reg4?her:him.}
dlga_political_quest_follow_on:close_window.1|Splendid. I shall await the materials.
dlga_combined_political_quests:political_quest_suggested.2|As you may realize, {s4} has many enemies among the lords of the {s5}. In particular, they feel that {reg4?she:he} is {s7}, and worry that {reg4?she:he} will {s8}. Were you to denounce {s4} to {reg4?her:his} face, you may reap much popularity -- although, of course, you would make an enemy of {reg4?her:him}, and risk being challenged to a duel.
dlga_combined_political_quests:political_quest_suggested.3|As you may realize, many of us in the peerage of the {s5} consider {s4} to be {s7}, and a liability to our cause. We worry that {reg4?she:he} will {s8}. People know my views on {s4} already, but if you were to denounce {reg4?her:him} to {reg4?her:his} face, you would further erode his standing -- and discourage our liege from entrusting {reg4?her:him} with any more power or responsibility. Of course, you would make an enemy of {reg4?her:him}, and risk being challenged to a duel.{s9}
dlga_political_quest_follow_on:close_window.2|We appreciate what you are doing. I find such intrigues distasteful, but it is all for the good of the {s5}.
dlga_political_quest_follow_on:close_window.3|Very well. It is always risky to involve yourself in intrigues of this sort, but in this case, I think you will benefit.
dlga_combined_political_quests:political_quest_suggested.4|You and I have a common interest in seeking to curtail the rise of {s4}. I feel that {reg4?she:he} is {s7}, and worry that {reg4?she:he} will {s8}. Were you to tell our liege {s9} your opinion of {s4}, it might discourage {s9} from granting {s4} any further powers or responsibilities, at least for a while, and I would be much obliged to you.
dlga_combined_political_quests:political_quest_suggested.5|I cannot think of anything right now, but we will have some items of mutual interest in the future.
dlga_political_quest_suggested:political_quest_follow_on|I like that idea.
dlga_political_quest_suggested:combined_political_quests|Hmm.. Maybe you can think of something else?
dlga_political_quest_suggested:political_quests_end|Let us discuss another topic
dlga_political_quests_end:lord_pretalk|Very well.
dlga_political_quests_end:spouse_pretalk|Very well.
dlga_political_quests_end:minister_pretalk|Very well.
dlga_political_quests_end:close_window|Very well.
dlga_start:local_merchant_mercy|Mercy! Please don't kill me!
dlga_local_merchant_mercy:local_merchant_mercy_no|I have nothing against you man. But {s2} wants you dead. Sorry.
dlga_local_merchant_mercy_no:close_window|Damn you! May you burn in Hell!
dlga_local_merchant_mercy:local_merchant_mercy_yes|I'll let you live, if you promise me...
dlga_local_merchant_mercy_yes:local_merchant_mercy_yes_2|Of course, I promise, I'll do anything. Just spare my life... 
dlga_local_merchant_mercy_yes_2:local_merchant_mercy_yes_3|You are going to forget about {s2}'s debt to you. And you will sign a paper stating that he owes you nothing.
dlga_local_merchant_mercy_yes_3:local_merchant_mercy_yes_4|Yes, of course. I'll do as you say.
dlga_local_merchant_mercy_yes_4:local_merchant_mercy_yes_5|And if my lord hears so much of a hint of a complaint about this issue, then I'll come back for you, and it won't matter how much you scream for mercy then. Do you understand me?
dlga_local_merchant_mercy_yes_5:local_merchant_mercy_yes_6|Yes {sir/madam}. Don't worry. I won't make any complaint.
dlga_local_merchant_mercy_yes_6:close_window|Good. Go now, before I change my mind.
dlga_start:fugitive_1|What do you want?
dlga_fugitive_1:fugitive_2|I am looking for a murderer by the name of {s4}. You fit his description.
dlga_fugitive_1:close_window|Nothing. Sorry to trouble you.
dlga_fugitive_2:fugitive_3|I don't understand, {sir/madam}. I never killed anyone. I think you've got the wrong man.
dlga_fugitive_3:fugitive_4|Then drop your sword. If you are innocent, you have nothing to fear. We'll go now and talk to your neighbours, and if they verify your story, I'll go on my way.
dlga_fugitive_4:fugitive_5|I'm not going anywhere, friend. You're going to have to fight for your silver, today.
dlga_fugitive_5:fugitive_fight_start|No problem. I really just need your head, anyway.
dlga_fugitive_5:fugitive_fight_start.1|I come not for money, but to execute the law!
dlga_fugitive_5:fugitive_fight_start.2|Alas, that you cannot be made to see reason.
dlga_fugitive_fight_start:close_window|Die, dog!
dlga_member_chat:sacrificed_messenger_1|Yes {sir/madam}?
dlga_sacrificed_messenger_1:sacrificed_messenger_2|Take this letter to {s1} and give it to {s2}.
dlga_sacrificed_messenger_1:close_window|Nothing. Nothing at all.
dlga_sacrificed_messenger_2:sacrificed_messenger_3|Yes {sir/madam}. You can trust me. I will not fail you.
dlga_sacrificed_messenger_3:close_window|Good. I will not forget your service. You will be rewarded when you return.
dlga_sacrificed_messenger_3:sacrificed_messenger_cancel|Aargh! I can't do this. I can't send you to your own death!
dlga_sacrificed_messenger_cancel:sacrificed_messenger_cancel_2|What do you mean {sir/madam}
dlga_sacrificed_messenger_cancel_2:sacrificed_messenger_cancel_3|There's a trap set up for you in the town. {s3} ordered me to sacrifice one of my chosen warriors to fool the enemy, but he will just need to find another way.
dlga_sacrificed_messenger_cancel_3:close_window|Thank you, {sir/madam}. I will follow you to the gates of hell. But this would not be a good death.
dlga_start:close_window.35|Don't worry, {sir/madam}, I'm on my way.
dlga_start:follow_spy_talk|Good day {sir/madam}. Such fine weather don't you think? If you'll excuse me now I must go on my way.
dlga_follow_spy_talk:follow_spy_talk_2|In the name of {s1}, you are under arrest!
dlga_follow_spy_talk_2:close_window|You won't get me alive!
dlga_follow_spy_talk:close_window|Never mind me. I was just passing by.
dlga_start:spy_partners_talk|Greetings.
dlga_spy_partners_talk:spy_partners_talk_2|In the name of {s1} You are under arrest!
dlga_spy_partners_talk_2:close_window|You will have to fight us first!
dlga_spy_partners_talk:close_window|Never mind me. I was just passing by.
dlga_start:runaway_serf_intro_1|Good day {sir/madam}.
dlga_runaway_serf_intro_1:runaway_serf_intro_2|I have been sent by your {s4} whom you are running from. He will not punish you if you return now.
dlga_runaway_serf_intro_2:runaway_serf_intro_3|My good {sir/madam}. Our lives at our village {s1} was unbearable. We worked all day long and still went to bed hungry. We are going to {s6} to start a new life, where we will be treated like humans.
dlga_runaway_serf_intro_3:runaway_serf_go_back|You have gone against our laws by running from your bondage. You will go back to {s1} now!
dlga_runaway_serf_intro_3:runaway_serf_let_go|Well, maybe you are right. All right then. If anyone asks, I haven't seen you.
dlga_runaway_serf_go_back:close_window|All right {sir/madam}. As you wish. We'll head back to {s5} now.
dlga_runaway_serf_let_go:close_window|God bless you, {sir/madam}. We will not forget your help.
dlga_start:runaway_serf_reconsider|Good day {sir/madam}. Don't worry. If anyone asks, we haven't seen you.
dlga_runaway_serf_reconsider:runaway_serf_go_back|I have changed my mind. You must back to your village!
dlga_runaway_serf_reconsider:runaway_serf_let_go|Good. Go quickly now before I change my mind.
dlga_start:runaway_serf_talk_caught|Good day {sir/madam}. We were heading back to {s5}, but I am afraid we lost our way.
dlga_runaway_serf_talk_caught:runaway_serf_go_back|Do not test my patience. You are going back now!
dlga_runaway_serf_talk_caught:runaway_serf_let_go|Well, if you are that eager to go, then go.
dlga_start:runaway_serf_talk_again_return|We are on our way back to {s5} {sir/madam}.
dlga_runaway_serf_talk_again_return:runaway_serf_talk_again_return_2|Make haste now. The sooner you return the better.
dlga_runaway_serf_talk_again_return:runaway_serf_talk_again_return_2.1|Good. Keep going.
dlga_runaway_serf_talk_again_return_2:close_window|Yes {sir/madam}. As you wish.
dlga_start:troublesome_bandits_intro_1|This must be your unlucky day, mate. We're just about the worst people you could run into, in these parts.
dlga_troublesome_bandits_intro_1:troublesome_bandits_intro_2|Heh. For me, you are nothing more than walking money bags. A merchant in {s1} offered me good money for your heads.
dlga_troublesome_bandits_intro_2:close_window|A bounty hunter! Kill {him/her}! Kill {him/her} now!
dlga_start:deserter_paid_talk|What do you want? You want to pay us some more money?
dlga_deserter_paid_talk:deserter_paid_talk_2a|Sorry to trouble you. I'll be on my way now.
dlga_deserter_paid_talk_2a:close_window|Yeah. Stop fooling around and go make some money. I want to see that purse full next time I see you.
dlga_deserter_paid_talk:deserter_paid_talk_2b|No. It's your turn to pay me this time.
dlga_deserter_paid_talk_2b:close_window|What nonsense are you talking about? You want trouble? You got it.
dlga_start:deserter_talk|We are the free brothers. We will fight only for ourselves from now on. Now give us your gold or taste our steel.
dlga_deserter_talk:close_window|When I'm done with you, you'll regret ever leaving your army.
dlga_deserter_talk:deserter_barter|There's no need to fight. I am ready to pay for free passage.
dlga_deserter_barter:deserter_barter_2|Good. You are clever. Now, having a look at your baggage, I reckon a fellow like you could pretty easily afford {reg5} crowns. We wouldn't want to be too greedy, now would we? Pay us, and then you can go.
dlga_deserter_barter_2:deserter_barter_3a|All right here's your {reg5} crowns.
dlga_deserter_barter_2:deserter_barter_3b|I don't have that much money with me
dlga_deserter_barter_3b:close_window|Too bad. Then we'll have to sell you to the slavers.
dlga_deserter_barter_3a:close_window|Heh. That wasn't difficult, now, was it? All right. Go now.
dlga_start:tavernkeeper_talk|Welcome to the tavern of the Three Crowns... do you want to drink or eat? Paris is a great city, and as I always say, there are so many more good things than bad.

dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:tavernkeeper_deliver_wine_incomplete|I was told to deliver you {reg9} units of {s4}, but I lost some of the cargo on the way.

dlga_tavernkeeper_deliver_wine_lost:tavernkeeper_pretalk|What? I was waiting for that {s4} for weeks! And now you are telling me that you lost it? You may rest assured that I will let {s1} know about this.
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:tavernkeeper_buy_drinks|I'd like to buy every man who comes in here tonight a jar of your best wine.
dlga_tavernkeeper_buy_drinks:tavernkeeper_buy_drinks_2|Of course, {my lord/my lady}. I reckon {reg5} crowns should be enough for that. What should I tell the lads?
dlga_tavernkeeper_buy_drinks_2:tavernkeeper_buy_drinks_end|Let everyone know of the generosity of {playername} to the people of {s10}.
dlga_tavernkeeper_buy_drinks_end:tavernkeeper_pretalk|Don't worry {sir/madam}. Your name will be cheered and toasted here all night.
dlga_tavernkeeper_buy_drinks_2:tavernkeeper_pretalk|Actually, cancel that order.
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:tavernkeeper_job_ask|Have you heard of anyone in this realm who might have a job for a {man/woman} like myself?
dlga_tavernkeeper_job_ask:tavernkeeper_job_search|Hmm... Well, {s10} is often looking for mercenaries to fight in his wars.{s9}
dlga_tavernkeeper_job_search:tavernkeeper_job_result|Let me think some more...
dlga_tavernkeeper_job_result:tavernkeeper_job_search|I have heard that {s7} {s9}{s10} You may want to speak with {reg4?her:him}.
dlga_tavernkeeper_job_result:tavernkeeper_job_result_2|There may be other work, of course -- lords and guildmasters often have other tasks which we don't hear about. Also, the villages around here frequently need help, although they'd be more likely to pay you with a wedge of cheese and goodwill than with cold hard crowns.
dlga_tavernkeeper_job_result_2:tavernkeeper_pretalk|I keep my ears open to other opportunities, ask me again from time to time.
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:goods_tavernier_requested|What do you sell?
dlga_goods_tavernier_requested:goods_tavernier_completed|What do you need?
dlga_goods_tavernier_completed:tavernkeeper_talk|Anything else?
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:tavernkeeper_trav|Anything particularly interesting to see in France?
dlga_tavernkeeper_trav:tavernkeeper_travend|The market of Bordeaux is worth a look, the St. Catherine street is full of merchants.
dlga_tavernkeeper_trav:tavernkeeper_travend.1|There's the great forge in Orleans, they make the best weapons there.
dlga_tavernkeeper_trav:tavernkeeper_travend.2|The Royal Stables in Paris are a sight to behold they say. They breed the best horses, it even seems that that you could actually buy one these days.
dlga_tavernkeeper_trav:tavernkeeper_travend.3|If you happen to get hurt, there's a very good doctor in Dijon. At least that's what the travelers have reported to me, I've never checked.
dlga_tavernkeeper_trav:tavernkeeper_travend.4|It seems that the Monastery of the Ladies in Marseille is infected with the plague. God forbid.
dlga_tavernkeeper_trav:tavernkeeper_travend.5|Be careful if you happen to go near the slums of Paris. That is a den of thieves and all kinds of thugs.
dlga_tavernkeeper_trav:tavernkeeper_travend.6|There is a siege engine workshop near Limoges. They say they are manufacturing new kinds of weapons there. Only if those could help us win this war...
dlga_tavernkeeper_trav:tavernkeeper_travend.7|There is a company of mercenaries based in Bourges. They recruit trained men at arms. It seems they pay well.
dlga_tavernkeeper_trav:tavernkeeper_travend.8|You could you commit yourself being a messenger if you have a fast horse. They don't pay so well but they have a lot of work to offer, that's what I keep hearing. You can find one of their guildmasters in Bourges, Bordeaux, Calais and Marseille.
dlga_tavernkeeper_travend:tavernkeeper_pretalk|Thank you for the information.
dlga_tavernkeeper_trav:close_window|I don't feel like talking to you, please leave.
dlga_tavernkeeper_war_3:tavernkeeper_pretalk|Well... if you want my opinion, we should take up arms and liberate France ourselves, expelling home-grown nobles at the same time.
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:tavernkeeper_war|What do you think of this war?
dlga_tavernkeeper_war:tavernkeeper_war_2|What I think?... It's too long. While the nobles dispute their land, peasants and honest people die in battle or elsewhere. For us little people, it's either die starving or on the field of honor. This strange choice even keeps coming back.
dlga_tavernkeeper_war_2:tavernkeeper_war_3|Can we do anything to change that?
dlga_tavernkeeper_war_2:tavernkeeper_pretalk|What do you want... it's the way things are.
dlga_tavernkeeper_war_3:close_window|I've already said too much...
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:tavernkeeper_cuisinier|I'd like to learn to cook rations for my company, can you help me?
dlga_tavernkeeper_cuisinier:tavernkeeper_cuisinier_2|It's possible, but you have to pay for kitchen utensils and ingredients.
dlga_tavernkeeper_cuisinier_2:tavernkeeper_cuisinier_3|I'll pay.
dlga_tavernkeeper_cuisinier_2:tavernkeeper_pretalk|I've spent enough for today, maybe later.
dlga_tavernkeeper_cuisinier_3:tavernkeeper_cuisinier_4|Well, you'll have to get a cauldron, kitchen utensils and some recipes. I just happen to have an extra cauldron that I could sell you for 230 crowns. I part with my utensils for 30 crowns, and every recipe you buy is 25 crowns. What do you want first?
dlga_tavernkeeper_cuisinier_4:tavernkeeper_cuisinier_chaud|I'd like a cauldron.
dlga_tavernkeeper_cuisinier_4:tavernkeeper_cuisinier_ust|I'll take the kitchen utensils.
dlga_tavernkeeper_cuisinier_4:tavernkeeper_cuisinier_recet|Show me your recipes?
dlga_tavernkeeper_cuisinier_4:tavernkeeper_cuisinier_fail|I do not have enough gold...
dlga_tavernkeeper_cuisinier_fail:tavernkeeper_pretalk|And now you say that... still, I spent time trying to help you. If you don't have gold to spend, I suggest you go to win some and come back later... no offense, but this is a business, not a charity.
dlga_tavernkeeper_cuisinier_chaud:tavernkeeper_cuisinier_4|Thank you, anything else?
dlga_tavernkeeper_cuisinier_ust:tavernkeeper_cuisinier_4|Thank you, anything else?
dlga_tavernkeeper_cuisinier_recet:tavernkeeper_recettes_start|Well, I have recipes for vegetable soup, cabbage stew and fish soup. Which one do you want?
dlga_tavernkeeper_recettes_start:tavernkeeper_rec_soup|I'll take the recipe for vegetable soup.
dlga_tavernkeeper_recettes_start:tavernkeeper_rec_choux|I'll take the recipe for cabbage stew.
dlga_tavernkeeper_recettes_start:tavernkeeper_rec_poisson|I think the fish soup should be interesting.
dlga_tavernkeeper_recettes_start:tavernkeeper_pretalk|That's all for the moment.
dlga_tavernkeeper_rec_soup:tavernkeeper_recettes_start|Thank you, anything else?
dlga_tavernkeeper_rec_choux:tavernkeeper_recettes_start|Thank you, anything else?
dlga_tavernkeeper_rec_poisson:tavernkeeper_recettes_start|Thank you, anything else?
dlga_tavernkeeper_cuisinier_4:tavernkeeper_pretalk|That's all for the moment.
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:tavernkeeper_coin|Want to play some dice?
dlga_tavernkeeper_coin:generique_des|Of course... it's not like I have any work to do.
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:tavernkeeper_discut|Can I ask you a delicate question?
dlga_tavernkeeper_discut:tavernkeeper_choix|About what?
dlga_tavernkeeper_prechoix:tavernkeeper_choix|What would you like to discuss?
dlga_tavernkeeper_choix:tavernkeeper_dame|About women.
dlga_tavernkeeper_dame:close_window|I can't tell you anything. Complete mystery, leave now.
dlga_tavernkeeper_dame:tavernkeeper_dame_2|...what do you want to know exactly?
dlga_tavernkeeper_dame_2:tavernkeeper_dame_3|Why should I marry...
dlga_tavernkeeper_dame_3:tavernkeeper_prechoix|Women... they say they want to take care of your property and cherish your offspring, no matter the size of your d... I mean your purse, of course. Indeed they'll take care of every one of your crowns.
dlga_tavernkeeper_choix:tavernkeeper_defeat|I think we are defeated in advance...
dlga_tavernkeeper_defeat:close_window|I've been advised to keep my nose out of these things...
dlga_tavernkeeper_defeat:tavernkeeper_defeat_2|We must not lose hope... even though we were defeated, we'll see that God wants France to return to his people, have faith.
dlga_tavernkeeper_defeat_2:tavernkeeper_defeat_3|You are right... keep the faith and God will lead us to victory.
dlga_tavernkeeper_defeat_2:tavernkeeper_prechoix|I really have to be in trouble to consider discussing this with the landlord...
dlga_tavernkeeper_defeat_3:tavernkeeper_prechoix|Well spoken, can I serve you something?
dlga_tavernkeeper_choix:tavernkeeper_bless|What should I do if I was injured?
dlga_tavernkeeper_bless:tavernkeeper_prechoix|Well... if you were in pain, you could rest in the shelters of a tavern. If you were severely affected, you should look for a priest to heal you with his medicine.
dlga_tavernkeeper_choix:tavernkeeper_train|Who could teach me to fight?
dlga_tavernkeeper_train:tavernkeeper_prechoix|You'll surely find soldiers ready to teach their knowledge to a novice if you pay them properly. Start looking in cities and ask around.
dlga_tavernkeeper_choix:tavernkeeper_hist|You must hear incredible stories in your tavern?
dlga_tavernkeeper_prehist:tavernkeeper_hist2|Want to hear another story?
dlga_tavernkeeper_hist:tavernkeeper_prehist|It's said that King Charles VI was mad... mad to the point of screaming and running around chasing people. I guess that royalty is also failing... eh... wait, I just understood why England declared war...
dlga_tavernkeeper_hist2:tavernkeeper_histmieu|Yes, another story... hopefully a little better.
dlga_tavernkeeper_histmieu:tavernkeeper_prehist2|Ha, well... let me think... yes, have you heard of the three-horned beast? Yes, it would seem that it's hiding in the ruined castles, coming only out when hungry. Some say it's satan itself. Others believe that the beast was born in the beginning of the war. To make war with men and overcome all...
dlga_tavernkeeper_prehist2:tavernkeeper_hist3|You want another?
dlga_tavernkeeper_hist3:tavernkeeper_talkencore|Yes... and put me up for a drink.
dlga_tavernkeeper_talkencore:tavernkeeper_pretalk|Listen carefully... have you heard of Joan the Maid? This little shepherdess out of Domrémy. It seems, and I surely didn't invent it, that she soundly defeated an entire regiment of British soldiers, even better, captured a fortress by herself. The mere sight of her banner would bewitch soldiers, who would throw themselves into a river... Some say it's the work of an archangel, others think the devil is behind it. In any case, that's what is being said. Well, I can't talk to you any more, it's getting late. 
dlga_tavernkeeper_hist3:tavernkeeper_pretalk|You just made that up... for the sole purpose of making me drink... do I really look like a peasant?
dlga_tavernkeeper_hist2:tavernkeeper_pretalk|I've heard enough... it's silly.
dlga_tavernkeeper_choix:tavernkeeper_pretalk|I have better things to do than talk.
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:close_window|I think I'd better go now...
dlga_start:afight_alcool1|Let me drink.
dlga_afight_alcool1:afight_alcool2|I don't like to drink alone.
dlga_afight_alcool1:close_window|You can drink all your booze, farewell.
dlga_afight_alcool2:afight_alcool3|Oh, yes? What would you say to a contest in this case? We put the money on the table and the one who is still standing leaves with it, what do you think?
dlga_afight_alcool3:afight_alcoolstart|A contest? Sounds good, I just needed an excuse to drink like a Templar.
dlga_afight_alcool3:close_window|I think I have better things to do than sleep on the floor of the tavern.

dlga_start:start_pugilat|Sir, come here. You look strong in combat, are you a soldier?
dlga_start_pugilat:start_pugilat2|You can say that, what can I do for you?
dlga_start_pugilat:close_window|No, I'm a merchant, farewell.
dlga_start_pugilat2:start_pugilat3|I organize fights in the cellar of the tavern, if you are interested you will be able to earn money by betting on you while reporting your bets to me. You say that this doesn't sound honest? Of course, these are not fights to the death, you will only risk a broken nose or a notch on the arm.
dlga_start_pugilat3:start_pugilatok|I am your man.
dlga_start_pugilat3:start_pugilatarmes|What kind of weapons do we fight with?
dlga_start_pugilatarmes:start_pugilat3|No worries for a champion such as you, you'll stick with a simple dagger, barely sharpened with a history that shows the blood of previous fighters. Not very impressive for a fighter of course, don't you agree? Good...
dlga_start_pugilat3:close_window|I have no pleasure in injuring myself of my own free will.
dlga_start_pugilatok:close_window|Beautiful, beautiful... just enter through this door and don't get seen, good luck.
dlga_start:start_pugilatspecta|Give us some of the money.

dlga_start:start_pugilatparieurwins|The winner is ... you ... amazing.
dlga_start_pugilatparieurwins:start_pugilatparieur_mfoi|What about my winnings?
dlga_start_pugilatparieurwins:close_window|It wasn't that hard, find someone else next time.
dlga_start_pugilatparieur_mfoi:start_pugilatparieur_mfoi2|What do you mean?
dlga_start_pugilatparieur_mfoi2:start_pugilatparieur_mfoi3|These gentlemen might like to bet on a fight between you and me...

dlga_start_pugilatparieur:start_pugilatparieursortie|I want to get out of here right now.
dlga_start_pugilatparieursortie:close_window|What, is that a joke? Oh, I get it, kid.
dlga_start_pugilatparieur_tobelt:pugi_to_fightt|Of course, how much do you want to lose?
dlga_pugi_to_fightt:pugi_to_fighttfait|20 crowns.
dlga_pugi_to_fightt:pugi_to_fighttfait.1|50 crowns.
dlga_pugi_to_fightt:pugi_to_fighttfait.2|100 crowns.
dlga_pugi_to_fightt:pugi_to_fighttrien|Nothing.
dlga_pugi_to_fighttrien:close_window|It's very funny...
dlga_pugi_to_fighttfait:pugi_to_fighttfait2|Sirs, no unfair shots and do not finish too fast, give us time to enjoy...
dlga_pugi_to_fighttfait2:close_window|Fight !!!
dlga_start:start_ribaude_tavern|Good evening. These muscles... they all seem so stiff. Allow me to rub one in particular... for a few pieces of course.
dlga_start_ribaude_tavern:start_ribaude_tavernok|How much?
dlga_start_ribaude_tavern:close_window|I don't need your service.
dlga_start_ribaude_tavernok:start_ribaude_tavernok2|200 crowns.
dlga_start_ribaude_tavernok2:start_ribaude_tavernok3|Hmm... what better can you get with that price?
dlga_start_ribaude_tavernok2:close_window|That's 200 crowns too much.
dlga_start_ribaude_tavernok3:start_ribaude_tavernok4|Master, I am your faithful servant. I could soothe and satisfy you... for the evening, of course. I have a grandfather to feed at dawn.
dlga_start_ribaude_tavernok4:start_ribaude_tavernok4go|Okay, if you speak no more.
dlga_start_ribaude_tavernok4:close_window|Not this time.
dlga_start_ribaude_tavernok4go:close_window|Okay, please follow me.
dlga_start:maconique_loge_s|Stop! Where do you think you're going, miscreant?
dlga_maconique_loge_s:maconique_loge_s2|We may be able to come to an arrangement...
dlga_maconique_loge_s2:close_window|We'll try to find one after your death.
dlga_start:maconique_p_capitale|I'm accusing! Attempting to steal the goods from Freemasons is punishable by Death.
dlga_maconique_p_capitale:maconique_p_capitale3|And if you explain to me what's going on...
dlga_maconique_p_capitale3:close_window|Enough talking, time to act.
dlga_start:fin_quete_temp|You will not regret it. Be assured, I told you everything I know.
dlga_fin_quete_temp:close_window|In that case, goodbye.
dlga_start:maconique_deux_chanceviela|You're back, are you finally interested in my precious information?
dlga_maconique_deux_chanceviela:maconique_deux_chanceviela2|Remind me of your story.
dlga_maconique_deux_chanceviela:close_window|Not at the moment, we'll see later.
dlga_maconique_deux_chanceviela2:maconique_deux_chanceviela3|Were you drunk when I told you about it? The clues, the templar order, the masonic organization and especially the treasure! The information, which will put you on the trail of the treasure of the Templars, yours only for 3000 crowns.
dlga_maconique_deux_chanceviela3:maconique_deux_chancevielaok|That's okay, I'll try my luck.
dlga_maconique_deux_chanceviela3:maconique_deux_chanceviela2no|Not at the moment, I have to think about it.
dlga_maconique_deux_chanceviela2no:close_window|Well, I'll continue traveling as long as no one has freed me from this cursed treasure, it's the only thing on my mind.
dlga_maconique_deux_chancevielaok:close_window|You are making a good deal, trust me. Well... you'll have to look for the Map of the Secret Temples, that's where they stored the gold of the crusades and their many incomes. For the time being the clue will take you to the library of the Benedictine abbey of Micy in Orléans, good luck.
dlga_start:dia_temp_startt|You have before you an exhausted man, but also a man who has the best deal to offer that you've ever heard. What do you say to that?
dlga_dia_temp_startt:dia_temp_startt_interet|It doesn't hurt to listen, what is it?
dlga_dia_temp_startt:close_window|I say no. Sorry, have had a good night. Farewell.
dlga_dia_temp_startt_interet:dia_temp_startt_interetsuit|Well that's my story, but first do you know of the order of the Templars? They were very powerful and very rich, until their last representatives were executed in 1310 by the Capetian king. Their gold hoard went missing. Few people even know of its existence.
dlga_dia_temp_startt_interetsuit:dia_temp_startt_interetsuit2|And you, how do you know this?
dlga_dia_temp_startt_interetsuit2:dia_temp_startt_interetsuit3|I heard of the legend while I was protecting my lord in his search for the treasure of Templars. He was murdered and I decided to continue the quest on my own when I realized I knew enough to do so. 
dlga_dia_temp_startt_interetsuit3:dia_temp_startt_interetfin|Your quest looks quite dangerous. Did you find who killed the lord?  
dlga_dia_temp_startt_interetfin:dia_temp_startt_interetfin2|You're right, I've come to find out that it's a secret society whose members call themselves Freemasons.
dlga_dia_temp_startt_interetfin2:dia_temp_startt_interetsuit_etfin|What does this have to do with me?
dlga_dia_temp_startt_interetsuit_etfin:dia_temp_starttpaye|I'm tired of this quest, it's been so long since I started. I'd now like to sleep without having to keep a hand on the hilt of my sword. I'd like to sell the information that I've collected in my travels. Though this is the kind of quest that can drive you crazy. Who knows how many have already tried and failed? I think I'm close to the goal but I feel I have to stop here. Night is falling for me and I've spent too many seasons running from town to town and wandered in the wild in search of clues. For 3000 crowns it's yours, what do you say?
dlga_dia_temp_starttpaye:dia_temp_startt_quetelancee|It's okay. It seems to me that you'd be inspired to prove if this story is real.
dlga_dia_temp_starttpaye:close_window|I think you are an excellent speaker and I could see you being skilled enough to woo some ladies of the court.
dlga_dia_temp_starttpaye:close_window.1|It doesn't interest me at the moment. Let's talk about this later on, if we ever meet again.

dlga_start:ransom_broker_intro|Greetings to you, {sir/madam}. You look like someone who should get to know me.
dlga_ransom_broker_intro:ransom_broker_intro_2|Why is that?
dlga_ransom_broker_intro_2:ransom_broker_info_talk|I broker ransoms for the poor wretches who are captured in these endless wars. Normally I travel between the salt mines and the slave markets on the coast, on commission from those whose relatives have gone missing. But if I'm out on my errands of mercy, and I come across a fellow dragging around a captive or two, well, there's no harm in a little speculative investment, is there? And you look like the type who might have a prisoner to sell.
dlga_ransom_broker_info_talk:ransom_broker_families|What if their families can't pay?
dlga_ransom_broker_families:ransom_broker_info_talk|Oh, then I spin them a few heart warming tales of life on the galleys. You'd be surprised what sorts of treasures a peasant can dig out of his cowshed or wheedle out of his cousins, assuming he's got the proper motivation! And if in the end they cannot come up with the silver, then there are always slave merchants who are looking for galley slaves. One cannot do Heaven's work with an empty purse, you see.
dlga_ransom_broker_info_talk:ransom_broker_prices|What can I get for a prisoner?
dlga_ransom_broker_prices:ransom_broker_info_talk|It varies. I fancy that I have a fine eye for assessing a ransom. There are a dozen little things about a man that will tell you whether he goes to bed hungry, or dines each night on soft dumplings and goose. The real money of course is in the gentry, and if you ever want to do my job you'll want to learn about every landowning family in France, their estates, their heraldry, their offspring both lawful and bastard, and, of course, their credit with the merchants.
dlga_ransom_broker_info_talk:ransom_broker_ransom_me|Would you be able to ransom me if I were taken?
dlga_ransom_broker_ransom_me:ransom_broker_info_talk|Of course. I'm welcome in every court in France. There's not many who can say that! So always be sure to keep a pot of crowns buried somewhere, and a loyal servant who can find it in a hurry.
dlga_ransom_broker_info_talk:ransom_broker_pretalk|That's all I need to know. Thank you.
dlga_start:ransom_broker_talk|Greetings. If you have any prisoners, I will be happy to buy them from you.
dlga_ransom_broker_pretalk:ransom_broker_talk|Anyway, if you have any prisoners, I will be happy to buy them from you.
dlga_ransom_broker_talk:ransom_broker_sell_prisoners|Then you'd better bring your purse. I have got prisoners to sell.
dlga_ransom_broker_talk:ransom_broker_intro_2|Tell me about what you do again.
dlga_ransom_broker_talk:ransom_broker_ransom_companion|I wish to ransom one of my companions.

I remember hearing that the rats down there are unusually large -- like mastiffs, they say... Now... For the very reasonable sum of {reg5} crowns, which includes both the ransom and my commission and expenses, we can arrange it so that {s5} can once again enjoy {reg4?her:his} freedom. What do you say?
dlga_ransom_broker_ransom_companion_verify:ransom_broker_ransom_companion_accept|Here's your money.
dlga_ransom_broker_ransom_companion_verify:ransom_broker_ransom_companion_refuse|I can't afford that right now.
dlga_ransom_broker_ransom_companion_accept:ransom_broker_talk|Splendid! In a few days, I would think, you should find {s5} riding to rejoin you, blinking in the sunlight and no doubt very grateful! Is there any other way in which I can help you?
dlga_ransom_broker_ransom_companion_refuse:ransom_broker_talk|Of course, of course... Never mind what they say about the rats, by the way -- I've never actually seen one myself, on account of the pitch-black darkness. Anyway, I'm sure that {s5} will understand why it's important for you to control expenditures. Now... Was there anything else?
dlga_ransom_broker_talk:close_window|Not this time. Good-bye.
dlga_ransom_broker_sell_prisoners:ransom_broker_sell_prisoners_2|Let me see what you have...
dlga_ransom_broker_sell_prisoners_2:close_window|I will be staying here for a few days. Let me know if you need my services.
dlga_start:tavern_traveler_talk|Greetings, friend. You look like the kind of {man/person} who'd do well to know me. I travel a lot all across France and keep an open ear. I can provide you information that you might find useful. For a meager price of course.
dlga_start:tavern_traveler_lost_companion_thanks|Greetings, {playername}. I saw your companion {s10} at a tavern in {s11} some days ago. I thought you might like to know.
dlga_tavern_traveler_lost_companion_thanks:tavern_traveler_pretalk|Thanks. I'll go and find {reg3?her:him} there.
dlga_tavern_traveler_lost_companion_thanks:tavern_traveler_pretalk.1|Thanks, but I don't really care.
dlga_start:tavern_traveler_talk.1|Greetings, {playername}.
dlga_tavern_traveler_pretalk:tavern_traveler_talk|Yes?
dlga_tavern_traveler_talk:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms|What can you tell me about this land?
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_2|France is divided by rival claimants to the throne, who can neither of them manage to live in peace with the other, nor completely eliminate them. As a result, there's seldom a break to the bitter wars which plague this land and drain its life blood. Well, at least this must be a good place to be for an adventurer such as yourself. With some luck and skill, you can make a name for yourself here, amass a fortune perhaps, or gain great power. Opportunities are endless and so are the rewards, if you are willing to risk your life for them.
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_2:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_3|Tell me more about these opportunities.
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_2:close_window|Thank you. That was all I needed to know
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_3:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4|Well, you probably know everything I could tell you already. You seem to be doing pretty well.
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_3:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4a|The kingdoms will pay good money for mercenaries if they are engaged in a war. If you have done a bit of fighting, speaking with one of their lords will probably result in being offered a mercenary contract. However the real rewards come if you can manage to become a vassal to a king. A vassal can own villages, castles and towns and get rich with the taxes and revenues of these estates. Normally, only nobles of the realm own land in this way, but in time of war, a king will not hesitate to accept someone who distinguishes {himself/herself} on the battlefield as a vassal, and grant {him/her} the right to own land.
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4a:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4|It is not unheard of for adventurers to renounce allegiance to a European king altogether, declare themselves kings, and claim land in their own name. This is a difficult path, however, as the great nobles of the land, with their long ancestries, are not likely to accept such upstarts as their monarch. Such rulers would need to be very careful in establishing their right to rule, or they would be set upon from all sides.
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_5|It might be easier for an adventurer like yourself to pledge support to an existing king's rival. There are many such pretenders in France -- those who are born to the right family, who go around and stir up trouble saying they have a better claim to the throne than the current king. If those claim holders could find supporters, they could easily start civil wars and perhaps even replace the king one day.
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_5:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_6|Interesting. Where can I find these claim holders?
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_5:close_window|I guess I heard enough already. Thank you.
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_6:tavern_traveler_pretalk|A claim holder's life would be in danger in his own country of course. Therefore, they usually stay at rival courts, raising support and hoping to find someone willing to champion their cause. I usually hear news about some of them, and may be able to tell you their location with some precision. But of course, I would ask for a little something for such a service.
dlga_tavern_traveler_talk:tavern_traveler_pretender_location|I want to know the location of a claimant.
dlga_tavern_traveler_pretender_location:tavern_traveler_pretender_location_ask|Whose location do you want to know?

dlga_start:minstrel_1|Greetings to you, {most noble sir/most noble lady}.
dlga_minstrel_1:minstrel_job_description|What is it you do?
dlga_minstrel_1:minstrel_courtship_questions|I have some questions about courtship in France
dlga_minstrel_1:minstrel_courtship_poem|Can you teach me any poems?
dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach|I can teach you the poem, 'The Storming of the Castle of Love.' It is short enough to be easily learned. It is an allegoric poem, replete with symbols and metaphor. It describes how a brave but rough warrior wins the heart of his lady by learning the virtues of chivalry, becoming a true and noble knight. Its theme -- that the role of a woman is to inspire but also civilize a man -- is appreciated by some noble ladies, but not all.
dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach.1|I can teach you the poem, 'The Heart's Desire.' It is a lyrical poem, which can be interpreted either erotically or spiritually. The lover realizes the majesty of the divine by gazing upon the body of his beloved. I believe that it appeals to women of a certain romantic temperament, but you risk scandalizing or boring others.
dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach.2|I can teach you the tale of Kais and Layala. It is a sad and simple story -- the shepherd boy Kais and the nobleman's daughter Layala love each other, but they can never marry. The poem is Kais' lament as he wanders alone, unwilling to forget his true love, driving himself mad with longing. Some ladies melt at the sweetness of his sorrows; others glaze over at his self-pity.
dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach.3|I can teach you part of the saga of Helgerad and Kara. It is a heroic tale, full of blood and battle. The shieldmaiden Kara chooses the warrior Helgered as her lover, as he is the only man who can defeat her in combat. Her father, who pledged her to another, comes with his sons and his huscarls to kill Helgered. They fight, and Helgered and Kara slaughter the entire host except for Kara's beloved younger brother -- who, alas, grows up to avenge his father by slaying Helgered. The depiction of warrior and shieldmaiden as equals will appeal to some women, but a mail-wearing, blood-spattered heroine will shock and repulse others.
dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach.4|I can teach you the poem, 'An Argument in the Garden.' It is a comic poem, which satirizes the conventions of courtly love. A lover steals into a garden in Veluca, and plies her with lots of witty lines to persuade his lover to submit to his embraces. She shoots down all of his advances one by one, then when he is downcast, she takes him in her arms and tells him that she wanted him all along, except on her terms, not his. A lady with a sense of humor may find it amusing, but others might feel that they are the ones who are being mocked.
dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem_teach:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach_2|To teach it to you, I will need some hours of your time -- and, of course, a small fee for my services. About 300 crowns would suffice.
dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem:minstrel_pretalk|I believe you already know the poems I am best equipped to teach.
dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem_teach_2:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach_3|Yes -- teach me that one
dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem_teach_2:minstrel_pretalk|Never mind
dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem_teach_3:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach_4|Very well -- repeat after me:^   I deflected her skeptical questioning darts^   with armor made of purest devotion^   purged in the forge of my heart^   from the slag of any baser emotion

dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions:minstrel_courtship_questions_2|What do you wish to know?
dlga_minstrel_courtship_prequestions:minstrel_courtship_questions_2|Can I answer any other questions for you?
dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_player_role|Is there a place for me in the game of love?
dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_player_advice_meet|How would a suitor meet a lady?
dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_player_advice_woo|Having met a lady, how would the suitor woo her?
dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_nobles|Tell me about marriage and love among the nobility of France
dlga_minstrel_nobles:minstrel_nobles_2|Nobles are an odd lot. In France, a daughter is a political asset, to be given away to a lord with whom her father wishes to make an alliance. Yet the great families of this land idealize pure love between man and woman, and I have seen many a hardened warrior weep copious tears at the doomed ardour of Sahira and Janun in the songs -- even as he made plans to break his own daughter's heart.
dlga_minstrel_nobles_2:minstrel_nobles_3|Fathers differ, of course. Some nobles will let their daughters choose a husband who pleases them. Others, however, feel that to allow their daughters any choice at all would be to diminish their own authority, and insist on imposing a groom whether she likes it or not.
dlga_minstrel_nobles_3:minstrel_prequestions|But the majority will steer a middle course -- they will want to make the final decision about a groom, but will weigh their daughter's preferences heavily. Among other factors, a happy marriage is more likely to produce heirs. So, there is a place for courtship, and for the use of skill and passion to win a lady's heart.
dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_daughter_father|What if a lady and her father disagree about a suitor?
dlga_minstrel_daughter_father:minstrel_daughter_father_2|It happens sometimes that a bride elopes. This is a major blow to the father's prestige, leading to lasting enmities. Indeed, it is possible that a war may be fought over a woman. Now, that is a fine topic for a song.
dlga_minstrel_daughter_father_2:minstrel_prequestions|In the end, however, most brides will submit to their parents' choice. A noblewoman's family is everything to her, and few are brave enough to risk its disapproval for the sake of man she barely knows. She may pine for her lover, but still accept the groom -- and without tragic love, what would we have to sing about?
dlga_minstrel_player_role:minstrel_player_role_2|Of course! High lords make a great deal of lineage, but in the end, lands and money speak louder than one's ancestors. Even though you are a foreigner, if you are coming up in the world, then many parents will consider you a fine catch.
dlga_minstrel_player_role_2:minstrel_player_role_3|You will have to compete with many other lords of your realm, however, who will have an advantage -- they have known these ladies from childhood, and will have been sized up as grooms by carefully discerning mothers and aunts. Some ladies may be fascinated by the stranger, yet opt for the familiar.
dlga_minstrel_player_role_3:minstrel_prequestions|So know this -- you may have your heart broken. But to enter the arena of love fearing heartbreak is like entering the battlefield fearing the enemy's arrows. Be brave, and shrug off the sting of rejection, and victory may yet be yours.
dlga_minstrel_player_role:minstrel_female_player_3|Lady -- I will speak bluntly. Most of the lords of this land are looking for a demure maiden, whose skin as fair as snow -- and your skin is burnt brown by the sun. They want a maiden whose voice is soft as bells -- and your voice is hoarse from commanding men in battle. Also, athough the lords of France appreciate poems about love, most also want heirs, and few women can ride and fight while with child.
dlga_minstrel_female_player_3:minstrel_prequestions|However, not all lords will be so conventionally minded. We poets sing of shield maidens and of huntresses, of women who forged their own path without having sacrificed the chance for love. I would not tell you that it would be easy for you to find a devoted husband who will accept your ways, but I would not say that it is impossible.
dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_spouse_benefits|What advantage is there in seeking a {wife/husband}?
dlga_minstrel_spouse_benefits:minstrel_wife_benefits_2|Ah! You are quite the romantic, I see! Well, aside from the obvious benefits of love, companionship and other, em, domestic matters, to marry among the nobility brings great assets. You may forge a strong alliance with the bride's family, and a wife may also assist you in manipulating the politics of the realm to your advantage.
dlga_minstrel_wife_benefits_2:minstrel_prequestions|What's more, most of the great families of France have at some point intermarried with royalty, which would boost your own claim to rule -- should you ever choose to assert it...
dlga_minstrel_spouse_benefits:minstrel_wife_benefits_2.1|Ah! You are quite the romantic, I see! Well, aside from the obvious benefits of love, companionship and other, em, domestic matters, to marry among the nobility brings great assets. You may have access to the groom's castles and properties, and be able to work with him to advance both of your standings in the realm.
dlga_minstrel_player_advice_meet:minstrel_player_advice_meet_2|Every so often, a king or great lord of the land will hold a feast. In towns they will often be accompanied by tournaments, and in castles they will be accompanied by hunts. The feasts provide a chance for the lords to repair some of the rivalries that may undermine the strength of the realm. They also provide an opportunity for families to show off their eligible daughters, and ladies will often be allowed to mingle unsupervised with the guests.
dlga_minstrel_player_advice_meet_2:minstrel_prequestions|If you have the opportunity, you may attempt to pay the lady a compliment. This indicates to her that you are a potential suitor, and she will usually know if she wishes you to continue your suit. Incidentally, if you come to her fresh from having distinguished yourself in the tournament or in the hunt, then you may make a stronger first impression than otherwise.
dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo:minstrel_player_advice_woo_2|To woo a lady takes a certain amount of time and patience, and several meetings spaced over a period of months. A lady who is interested in you will often find ways of letting you know if she wishes you to come visit her. Alternately, you may simply go and ask her father or brother for permission. If you do not have permission from her guardian, it may be possible to arrange an assignation through other means.
dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo_2:minstrel_player_advice_woo_3|Having arranged an assignment, you may then attempt to charm her and win her favor. Perhaps one of the most difficult aspects of this is finding a topic of conversation. Most noblewomen lead a cloistered life, at least until they are married, and thus will have little to say that will interest you. On other hand, she will soon tire of hearing of your own deeds in the outside world.
dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo_3:minstrel_player_advice_woo_4|One time-tested mode of courtship is simply to recite a popular poem, and discuss it. This way, you are both on an equal footing, and neither will have an advantage in knowledge or experience. Of course, different ladies will have different tastes in poetry.
dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo_4:minstrel_player_advice_woo_5|At some point, you will be able to discuss directly the issue of marriage. She will then let you know if you measure up to what she wants in a husband. Some ladies will coolly assess who is the most prestigious of her suitors, others will be guided by their passions. Some will look to your companions, to see whether you are the kind of husband who will treat her as an equal, while others will follow the lead of their fathers.
dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo_5:minstrel_prequestions|At any rate, it is a challenging business -- and do not forget, you may find that your suit prospers with a lady, only to have it falter on a father's political ambitions. So you must ask yourself: are you willing to risk disappointment and heartbreak? Alternately, are you willing to throw away your standing in society, to make enemies of allies, in pursuit of a forbidden love? Because if you are, then perhaps some day we will write poems about you.
dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_job_description|What is it that you poets and musicians do again?
dlga_minstrel_job_description:minstrel_courtship_prequestions|I compose and write songs for the lords of the land, and their ladies. Sometimes I sing about war, sometimes about the virtues of kings, and sometimes, for the more sophisticated audiences, about the virtues of wine. For most audiences, however, I sing of love.
dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_pretalk|No, that is all.
dlga_minstrel_prequestions:minstrel_courtship_questions_2|Do you have any other questions?
dlga_minstrel_pretalk:minstrel_1|Is there anything else?

dlga_trainer_intro_1:trainer_intro_2|Thank you for your advice. This place looks like a training field. Maybe I can learn about fighting here?
dlga_trainer_intro_2:trainer_intro_3|Indeed you can. I am a veteran soldier... fought a good deal in the wars in my time. But these days, I train young novices in this area. I can find you some opponents to practice with if you like. Or if you have any questions about the theory of combat, feel free to ask.
dlga_trainer_intro_3:trainer_intro_4a|Yes, I do have a few questions.
dlga_trainer_intro_3:trainer_intro_4b|Actually, I can move on to practice.
dlga_trainer_intro_4a:trainer_talk_combat|Well, ask anything you like.
dlga_trainer_intro_4b:trainer_practice_1|Good. It's good to find someone eager for practice. Let's see what you will do.
dlga_start:trainer_practice_1|That was a good fight. 
dlga_start:trainer_practice_1.1|Ha! Looks like you've developed a bit of a limp there. Don't worry, even losses have their value, provided you learn from them. Shake the stars out of your eyes and get back in there. There's no other way to win.
dlga_start:trainer_talk|Good day. Ready for some training today?
dlga_trainer_pretalk:trainer_talk|Ah, are you ready for some training?
dlga_trainer_talk:trainer_practice_1|I am ready for some practice.
dlga_trainer_talk:trainer_combat_begin|First, tell me something about combat...
dlga_trainer_talk:close_window|I need to leave now. Farewell.
dlga_trainer_combat_begin:trainer_talk_combat|What do you want to know?
dlga_trainer_combat_pretalk:trainer_talk_combat|What else do you want to know?
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_defense|Tell me about defending myself.
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_attack|Tell me about attacking with weapons.
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_horseback|Tell me about fighting on horseback.
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_pretalk|I guess I know all the theory I need. Let's talk about something else.
dlga_trainer_explain_defense:trainer_explain_defense_2|Good question. The first thing you should know as a fighter is how to defend yourself. Keeping yourself out of harm's way is the first rule of combat, and it is much more important than giving harm to others. Everybody can swing a sword around and hope to cut some flesh, but only those fighters that are experts at defense live to tell of it.
dlga_trainer_explain_defense_2:trainer_explain_defense_3|Now. Defending yourself is easiest if you are equipped with a shield. Just block with your shield. [Hold down the right mouse button to defend yourself with the shield.] In this state, you will be able to deflect all attacks that come from your front. However, you will still be open to strikes from your sides or your back.
dlga_trainer_explain_defense_3:trainer_explain_defense_4|What if I don't have a shield?
dlga_trainer_explain_defense_4:trainer_combat_pretalk|Then you will have to use your weapon to block your opponent. This is a bit more difficult than defending with a shield. Defending with a weapon, you can block against only ONE attack direction. That is, you block against either overhead swings, side swings or thrusts. Therefore you must watch your opponent carefully and start to block AFTER he starts his attack. In this way you will be able to block against the direction of his current attack. If you start to block BEFORE he makes his move, he may just attack in another direction than the one you are blocking against and score a hit.
dlga_trainer_explain_attack:trainer_explain_attack_2|Good question. Attacking is the best defence, they say. A tactic many fighters find useful is taking an offensive stance and readying your weapon for attack, waiting for the right moment for swinging it. [You can ready your weapon for attack by pressing and holding down the left mouse button.]
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_2:trainer_explain_attack_3|That sounds useful.
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_3:trainer_explain_attack_4|It is a good tactic, but remember that, your opponent may see that and take a defensive stance against the direction you are swinging your weapon. If that happens, you must break your attack and quickly attack from another direction [You may cancel your current attack by quickly tapping the right mouse button].
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_4:trainer_explain_attack_5|If my opponent is defending against the direction I am attacking from, I will break and use another direction.
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_5:trainer_combat_pretalk|Yes, selecting the direction you swing your weapon is a crucial skill. There are four main directions you may use: right swing, left swing, overhead swing and thrust. You must use each one wisely. [to control your swing direction with default controls, move your mouse in the direction you want to swing from as you press the left mouse button].
dlga_trainer_explain_horseback:trainer_combat_pretalk|Very good question. A horse may be a warrior's most powerful weapon in combat. It gives you speed, height, power and initiative. A lot of deadly weapons will become even deadlier on horseback. However you must pay particular attention to horse-mounted enemies couching their lances, as they may take down any opponent in one hit. [To use the couched lance yourself, wield a lance or similar weapon, and speed up your horse without pressing attack or defense buttons. After you reach a speed, you'll lower your lance. Then try to target your enemies by maneuvering your horse.]
dlga_trainer_practice_1:trainer_practice_1|I train novices in four stages, each tougher than the one before. To finish a stage and advance to the next one, you have to win three fights in a row.
dlga_trainer_practice_1:novicemaster_are_you_ready|You have passed all stages of training. But if you want you can still practice. Are you ready?
dlga_trainer_practice_1:trainer_practice_1.1|Way to go {lad/lass}. With this victory, you have advanced to the next training level. From now on your opponents will be regular fighters, not the riff-raff off the street, so be on your toes.
dlga_trainer_practice_1:trainer_practice_1.2|Way to go {lad/lass}. Welcome to the third training level. From now on your opponents will be veteran fighters; soldiers and arena regulars and the like. These guys know some dirty tricks, so keep your defense up.
dlga_trainer_practice_1:trainer_practice_1.3|You've got the heart of a champion, {lad/lass}, and the sword arm to match. From now on your opponents will be champion fighters. These are the cream of the crop, the finest warriors I have trained. If you can best three of them in a row, you will join their ranks.
dlga_trainer_practice_1:novicemaster_finish_training|It does my heart good to see such a promising talent. You have passed all tiers of training. You can now tell everyone that you have been trained by the master of the training field.
dlga_novicemaster_finish_training:novicemaster_finish_training_2|Thank you master.
dlga_novicemaster_finish_training_2:close_window|I wish you good luck in the tournaments. And, don't forget, if you want to practice your swordsmanship any time, just come and say the word.
dlga_trainer_practice_1:novicemaster_are_you_ready.1|Your next opponent will be a {s9}. You need to win {reg8} more fights in a row to advance to the next stage. Are you ready?
dlga_novicemaster_are_you_ready:novicemaster_ready_to_fight|Yes I am.
dlga_novicemaster_ready_to_fight:close_window|Here you go then. Good luck.
dlga_novicemaster_are_you_ready:novicemaster_not_ready|Just a minute. I am not ready yet.
dlga_novicemaster_not_ready:close_window|Hey, You will never make it if you don't practice.
dlga_start_craftsman_soon:close_window|Good day, my {lord/lady}. We hope to begin production in about {reg4} days
dlga_start:master_craftsman_talk|Good day, my {lord/lady}. We are honored that you have chosen to visit us. What do you require?
dlga_master_craftsman_pretalk:master_craftsman_talk|Very good, my {lord/lady}. Do you require anything else?
dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_accounts|Let's go over the accounts.
dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_pretalk|Let's check the inventories.
dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_pretalk.1|I'd like you to sell goods as they are produced.
dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_pretalk.2|I'd like you to keep all goods in the warehouse until I arrive.
dlga_master_craftsman_accounts:master_craftsman_pretalk|We currently produce {s3} worth {reg1} crowns each week, while the quantity of {s4} needed to manufacture it costs {reg2}, and labor and upkeep are {reg3}.{s9} This means that we theoretically make a {s12} of {reg0} crowns a week, assuming that we have no raw materials in the inventories, and that we sell directly to the market.
dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_production_options|Could you explain my options related to production?
dlga_master_craftsman_production_options:master_craftsman_production_options_2|Certainly, my {lord/lady}. Most of the time, the most profitable thing for you to do would be to let us buy raw materials and sell the finished goods directly to the market. Because of our long-standing relations with the local merchants, we can usually get a very good price.
dlga_master_craftsman_production_options_2:master_craftsman_pretalk|However, if you find that you can acquire raw materials cheaper outside {s5}, you may place them in the inventories, and we will use them instead of buying from the market. Likewise, if you feel that you can get a better price for the finished goods elsewhere, then you may ask us to deposit what we produce in our warehouses for you to take.
dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_auction_price|It will no longer be possible for me to continue operating this enterprise.
dlga_master_craftsman_auction_price:master_craftsman_auction_decide|A pity, my {lord/lady}. If we sell the land and the equipment, and liquidate the inventories, I estimate that we can get {reg4} crowns.
dlga_master_craftsman_auction_decide:master_craftsman_liquidation|That sounds reasonable. Please proceed with the sale.
dlga_master_craftsman_auction_decide:master_craftsman_pretalk|Hmm. Let's hold off on that.
dlga_master_craftsman_liquidation:close_window|As you wish. It was an honor to have been in your employ.
dlga_master_craftsman_talk:close_window.1|That is all for now.

As the townspeople of {s19}, know that we'll be good on our word, and we are ready to pay the {reg12} crowns we promised.
dlga_lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_completed:lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_pay|Thank you. Let me have the money.
dlga_lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_completed:lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_no_pay|No need for a payment. I only did what was right.
dlga_lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_pay:close_window|Oh, yes, of course. We had already got the money for you. Here, please accept these {reg12} crowns together with our most sincere thanks. Me and the people of our town will not forget your help.
dlga_lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_no_pay:close_window|You are indeed an extraordinary person, {sir/madame}, and it is an honour for me to have known you. You not only did what was impossible and put an end to this terrible war, but you won't even accept a reward for it. Very well, I will not insist on the matter, but please know that you will have our eternal respect and gratitude.
dlga_mayor_begin:lord_deal_with_night_bandits_completed|Very nice work, {playername}, you made short work of those lawless curs. Thank you kindly for all your help, and please accept this bounty of 150 crowns.
dlga_lord_deal_with_night_bandits_completed:close_window|It was my pleasure, {s65}.
dlga_mayor_begin:mayor_looters_quest_response|Ah, {playername}. Have you any progress to report?
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_response:mayor_looters_quest_destroyed|I've killed some looters.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_response:mayor_looters_quest_goods|I've brought you some goods.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_response:close_window|Not yet, sir. Farewell.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_destroyed:mayor_looters_quest_destroyed_2|Aye, my scouts saw the whole thing. That should make anyone else think twice before turning outlaw! The bounty is 40 crowns for every band, so that makes {reg1} in total. Here is your money, as promised.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_destroyed_2:close_window|And that's not the only good news! Thanks to you, the looters have ceased to be a threat. We've not had a single attack reported for some time now.   If there are any of them left, they've either run off or gone deep into hiding. That's good for business, and what's good for business is good for the town!   I think that concludes our arrangement, {playername}. Please accept this silver as a token of my gratitude. Thank you, and farewell.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_destroyed_2:mayor_looters_quest_response|Anything else you need?
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_goods:mayor_looters_quest_goods_response|Hah, I knew I could count on you! Just tell me which item to take from your baggage, and I'll send some men to collect it. I still need {reg1} crowns' worth of goods.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_goods_response:mayor_looters_quest_goods_2|{s5}.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_goods_response:mayor_looters_quest_goods_3|Nothing at the moment, sir.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_goods_3:mayor_looters_quest_response|Anything else you need?
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_goods_2:mayor_looters_quest_goods_response|Excellent, here is the money for your {s6}. Do you have any more goods to give me? I still need {reg1} crowns' worth of goods.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_goods_2:close_window|Well done, {playername}, that's the last of the goods I need. Here is the money for your {s6}, and a small bonus for helping me out. I'm afraid I won't be paying for any more goods, nor bounties on looters, but you're welcome to keep hunting the bastards if any remain. Thank you for your help, I won't forget it.
dlga_mayor_begin:close_window|Good to see you again {playername}. I have heard that you have delivered the cattle successfully. I will tell the merchants how reliable you are. And here is your pay, {reg8} crowns.
dlga_mayor_begin:move_cattle_herd_failed|I heard that you have lost the cattle herd on your way to {s9}. I had a very difficult time explaining your failure to the owner of that herd, {sir/madam}. Do you have anything to say?
dlga_move_cattle_herd_failed:move_cattle_herd_failed_2|I am sorry. But I was attacked on the way.
dlga_move_cattle_herd_failed:move_cattle_herd_failed_2.1|I am sorry. The stupid animals wandered off during the night.
dlga_move_cattle_herd_failed_2:merchant_ask_for_debts|Well, it was your responsibility to deliver that herd safely, no matter what. You should know that the owner of the herd demanded to be compensated for his loss, and I had to pay him 1000 crowns. So you now owe me that money.
dlga_mayor_begin:close_window.1|{playername} -- I am in your debt for bringing back my friend's daughter.  Please take these {reg8} crowns that I promised you.  My friend wished he could give more but paying that ransom brought him to his knees.
dlga_mayor_begin:mayor_friendly_pretalk|Well -- it sounds like you were able to track down the bandits, and show them what happens to those who would disrupt the flow of commerce. Here is your reward: {reg5} crowns. It is well earned, and we are most grateful.
dlga_mayor_begin:mayor_friendly_pretalk.1|I have heard about your deeds. You have given those bandits the punishment they deserved. You are really as good as they say. Here is your reward: {reg5} crowns. I would like to give more but those bandits almost brought me to bankruptcy.
dlga_mayor_begin:merchant_ask_for_debts|According to my accounts, you owe the merchants guild {reg1} crowns. I'd better collect that now.
dlga_merchant_ask_for_debts:merchant_debts_paid|Alright. I'll pay my debt to you.
dlga_merchant_debts_paid:mayor_pretalk|Excellent. I'll let my fellow merchants know that you are clear of any debts.
dlga_merchant_ask_for_debts:merchant_debts_not_paid|I'm afraid I can't pay that sum now.
dlga_merchant_debts_not_paid:close_window|In that case, I am afraid, I can't deal with you. Guild rules... Come back when you can pay the {reg1} crowns. And know that we'll be charging an interest to your debt. So the sooner you pay it, the better.
dlga_mayor_begin:mayor_talk|What can I do for you?
dlga_mayor_friendly_pretalk:mayor_talk|Now... What else may I do for you?
dlga_mayor_pretalk:mayor_talk|Yes?
dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_info_begin|Can you tell me about what you do?
dlga_mayor_talk:merchant_quest_requested|Do you happen to have a job for me?
dlga_mayor_talk:merchant_quest_last_offered_job|About that job you offered me...
dlga_mayor_talk:merchant_quest_about_job|About the job you gave me...
dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_political_talk|I have some questions of a political nature.
dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_economy_report_1|How is trade around here?
dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_wealth_comparison_1|How does the wealth of this region compare with the rest of France?
dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_investment_possible|I wish to buy land in this town for a productive enterprise
dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_pretalk|You already operate a {s4} here. There probably aren't enough skilled tradesmen to start a second enterprise.
dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_pretalk.1|{s9}
dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_investment_advice.1|Of course, {sir/my lady}. You are the lord of this town, and no one is going to stop you.
dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_investment|Well... Given your relationship with our liege, {s4}, I think that you will not find many here who are brave enough to sell you any land.
dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_pretalk.2|Well... To be honest, I think that we in the guild would like to know you a little better. We can be very particular about outsiders coming in here and buying land.
dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_investment_advice.2|Very good, {sir/my lady}. We in the guild know and trust you, and I think I could find someone to sell you the land you need.
dlga_mayor_investment_advice:investment_choose_enterprise|A couple of things to keep in mind -- skilled laborers are always at a premium, so I doubt that you will be able to open up more than one enterprise here. In order to make a profit for yourself, you should choose a commodity which is in relatively short supply, but for which the raw materials are cheap. What sort of enterprise would you like to start?
dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary|A mill and bakery, to make bread from grain
dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.1|A brewery, to make ale from grain
dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.2|A tannery, to make leather from hides
dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.3|A wine press, to make wine from grapes
dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.4|An oil press, to make oil from olives
dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.5|An ironworks, to make tools from iron
dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.6|A weavery and dyeworks, to make velvet from silk and dye
dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.7|A weavery, to make wool cloth from wool
dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.8|A weavery, to make linen from flax
dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:mayor_pretalk|Never mind
dlga_investment_summary:mayor_investment_confirm|Very good, sir. The land and the materials on which you may build your {s3} will cost you {reg7} crowns. Right now, your {s3} will produce {s4} worth {reg1} crowns each week, while the {s6} needed to manufacture that batch will be {reg2} and labor and upkeep will be {reg3}.{s9} I should guess that your profit would be {reg0} crowns a week. This assumes of course that prices remain constant -- which, I can virtually guarantee you, they will not. Do you wish to proceed?
dlga_mayor_investment_confirm:mayor_investment_purchase|Yes. Here is money for the land.
dlga_mayor_investment_confirm:mayor_pretalk|No -- that's not economical for me at the moment.
dlga_mayor_investment_purchase:mayor_pretalk|Very good. Your enterprise should be up and running in about a week. When next you come, and thereafter, you should speak to your {s4} about its operations.
dlga_mayor_talk:close_window|[Leave]
dlga_mayor_info_begin:mayor_info_talk|I am the guildmaster of {s9}. You can say I am the leader of the good people of {s9}. I can help you find a job if you are looking for some honest work.
dlga_mayor_info_talk:mayor_info_lord|Who rules this town?
dlga_mayor_info_lord:mayor_info_talk|Our town's lord and protector is {s10}. He owns the castle and sometimes resides there, and collects taxes from the town. However we regulate ourselves in most of the matters that concern ourselves. As the town's guildmaster I have the authority to decide those things.
dlga_mayor_info_talk:mayor_pretalk|That's all I need to know. Thanks.
dlga_mayor_political_talk:mayor_political_questions|Politics? Good heaven, the guild has nothing to do with politics. We are loyal servants of {s10}. We merely govern our own affairs, and pass on the townspeople's concerns to our lords and masters, and maybe warn them from time to time against evil advice. Anyway, what did you wish to ask?
dlga_mayor_prepolitics:mayor_political_questions|Did I mention that we here are all {s9}? Because I can't stress that enough... Anyway... Is there anything else?
dlga_mayor_political_questions:mayor_war_description_1|What is the cause of all these wars in France?
dlga_mayor_war_description_1:mayor_war_description_2|Well, to answer your question generally, each monarch claims to be the rightful heir to the old Calradic emperors. Some of these claims are based on forgotten dynastic marriages and others are based on obscure promises, while {s22} Rhodoks invoke the empire's unwritten constitution. So in theory, any one realm has the right to declare war on any other realm at any time.
dlga_mayor_war_description_2:mayor_war_description_3|In practice, to make war is exhausting work. It is easy enough to lay waste to the enemy's farmland, but crops will grow back, and it is a far different matter to capture an enemy stronghold and to hold it. So the monarchs of Europe will fight a little, sign a truce, fight a little more, and so on and so forth. Often, a monarch will go to war when another realm provokes them. At such times, some bad influences who look to enrich themselves with ransoms and pillage will clamor for retribution, and thus the damage caused by war to a monarch's treasury is less than the damage caused by doing nothing would be to his authority... I'm of course not talking about {s10}, as no one would ever question {reg4?her:his} authority
dlga_mayor_war_description_3:mayor_war_description_4|I would stress again that we in the guild have nothing to do with politics. But if {s10} were to ask for my advice on these matters, as a loyal subject, I would tell {reg4?her:him} that while {reg4?her:his} claim to the throne is truly just, even the most legitimate claim must be backed by armed men, and armed men want money, and money comes from trade, and war ruins trade, so sometimes the best way to push a claim is not to push it, if you know what I mean...
dlga_mayor_war_description_4:mayor_prepolitics|You may tell {s10} this if you see {reg4?her:him}. Don't mention my name specifically -- just say 'the people of {s4}' told you this. Our personal opinion, of course, as to what would be in {s10}'s best interests. None of us would ever dream of questioning a monarch's sovereign right to push {reg4?her:his} legitimate claims.
dlga_mayor_political_questions:mayor_politics_assess|What is {s10}'s policy in regards to the other realms of Europe?
dlga_mayor_politics_assess:mayor_politics_assess_realm|Which realm did you have in mind?
dlga_mayor_politics_assess_realm:mayor_politics_give_realm_assessment|{s11}
dlga_mayor_politics_give_realm_assessment:mayor_prepolitics|{s14}
dlga_mayor_political_questions:mayor_internal_politics|What can you say about the internal politics of the realms?
dlga_mayor_internal_politics:mayor_internal_politics_2|Well, here in the {s4} we are all united by our love for {s5} and support for {reg4?her:his} legitimate claim to the rulership of all France. But I have heard some talk of internal bickering in other realms...
dlga_mayor_internal_politics_2:mayor_internal_politics_3|The lords of a realm often have very different ideas about honor, strategy, and the way a nobleman should behave. In addition, they compete with each other for the ruler's favor, and are constantly weighing up their position -- how they stand, how their friends and family stand, and how their enemies stand.
dlga_mayor_internal_politics_3:mayor_internal_politics_4|Underlying all the tensions is the possibility that a lord may abandon his liege, and pledge as vassal to another. In theory, each lord has sworn an oath of vassalage, but in practice, a vassal can always find an excuse to absolve himself. The vassal may claim that the liege has failed to hold up his end of the bargain, to protect the vassal and treat him justly. Or, the vassal may claim that his liege is in fact a usurper, and another has a better claim to the kingship.
dlga_mayor_internal_politics_4:mayor_internal_politics_5|Lieges and vassals still watch each other carefully. If a king believes that his vassal is going to change sides or rebel, he may indict the vassal for treason and seize his properties. Likewise, if a vassal fears that he will be indicted, he may rebel. Usually, whoever makes the first move will be able to control the vassal's fortresses.
dlga_mayor_internal_politics_5:mayor_prepolitics|Now, men do not trust a vassal who turns coat easily, nor do they trust a king who lightly throws around charges of treason. Those two factors can keep a realm together. But if relations between a vassal and a liege deteriorate far enough, things can become very tense indeed... In other lands, of course. These things could never happen here in the {s4}.
dlga_mayor_political_questions:mayor_pretalk|That is all. Thank you.
dlga_merchant_quest_about_job:merchant_quest_about_job_2|What about it?
dlga_merchant_quest_about_job_2:merchant_quest_what_if_fail|What if I can't finish it?
dlga_merchant_quest_about_job_2:merchant_quest_about_job_working|Well, I'm still working on it.
dlga_merchant_quest_about_job_working:mayor_pretalk|Good. I'm sure you will handle it.
dlga_merchant_quest_last_offered_job:merchant_quest_brief|Eh, you want to reconsider that. Good...
dlga_merchant_quest_what_if_fail:mayor_pretalk|I hope you don't fail. In that case, I'll have to ask for the price of the cargo you were carrying.
dlga_merchant_quest_what_if_fail:mayor_pretalk.1|Well, just do your best to finish it.
dlga_merchant_quest_taken:mayor_pretalk|Excellent. I am counting on you then. Good luck.
dlga_merchant_quest_stall:mayor_pretalk|Well, the job will be available for a few more days I guess. Tell me if you decide to take it.
dlga_mayor_economy_report_1:mayor_economy_report_2|{s32}
dlga_mayor_economy_report_2:mayor_economy_report_3|{s42}
dlga_mayor_economy_report_3:mayor_pretalk|{s47}
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief|Well, you look able enough. I think I might have something you could do.
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:merchant_quest_looters_choice|We've had some fighting near the {s5} lately, with all the chaos that comes with it, and that's led some of our less upstanding locals to try and make their fortune out of looting the shops and farms during the confusion. A lot of valuable goods were taken. I need somebody to teach those bastards a lesson. Sound like your kind of work?
dlga_merchant_quest_looters_choice:merchant_quest_looters_brief|Aye, I'll do it.
dlga_merchant_quest_looters_choice:merchant_quest_stall|I'm afraid I can't take the job at the moment.
dlga_merchant_quest_looters_brief:close_window|Excellent! You'll find the looters roaming around the countryside, probably trying to rob more good people. Kill or capture the bastards, I don't care what you do with them. I'll pay you a bounty of 40 crowns on every band of looters you destroy, until all the looters are dealt with.
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_explain_2|Well, there is a very great favor which you could do us... As you may have heard, some {s10}s have come across the border to attack our people. {s5} is under great pressure from some of the more bellicose of his vassals to respond with a declaration of war. Unfortunately, while the great lords of this land grow rich from bloodshed, we of the commons will be caught in the middle, and will suffer.
dlga_merchant_quest_explain_2:merchant_quest_brief|We are not saying that {s5} should overlook this aggression -- far from it! But if he charges one of his own lords to respond, then the cycle of provocation will necessarily lead to a full-fledged confrontation. Now, if an outsider were to step in and defeat a {s10} lord in battle, then honor would be done, and it would defuse the clamor for war. If the defeated lord were a known troublemaker -- {s7} -- then the {s10}s might be able to overlook it.
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:merchant_quest_retaliate_confirm|We need you to attack and defeat {s7}. This will not be an easy task, and that outsider would damage {his/her} relationship with the {s10}s, but we would be very grateful. We could not acknowledge a connection with that outsider, but we could be sure that {he/she} would be handsomely rewarded... Could you do this?
dlga_merchant_quest_retaliate_confirm:merchant_quest_track_bandits_brief|Aye, I can do it.
dlga_merchant_quest_retaliate_confirm:merchant_pretalk|I would prefer not to get mixed up in such things
dlga_destroy_lair_quest_brief:merchant_quest_track_bandit_lair_choice|The raiders are likely to have laid up their ships in a well-concealed cove, somewhere along the coastline, preferably next to a small stream where they have some water. The best way to discover its location would be to find a group of sea raiders who appear to be heading back to their base to resupply, and follow them.
dlga_destroy_lair_quest_brief:merchant_quest_track_bandit_lair_choice.1|Bandits such as these usually establish their hideouts in the foothills on the edge of the desert, often in a canyon near a spring. This gives them both water and concealment. The best way to discover its location would be to find a group of desert bandits who appear to be heading back to their base to resupply, and follow them.
dlga_destroy_lair_quest_brief:merchant_quest_track_bandit_lair_choice.2|Bandits such as these will usually establish a base in the highlands, often on an steep ledge where they have a view of the surrounding countryside. This makes them difficult to surprise. The best way to discover its location would be to find a group of mountain bandits who appear to be heading back to their base to resupply, and follow them.
dlga_destroy_lair_quest_brief:merchant_quest_track_bandit_lair_choice.3|Bandits such as these will usually set up their encampments deep in the woods, sometimes in the middle of a swamp. The best way to discover its location would be to find a group of forest bandits who appear to be heading back to their base to resupply, and follow them.
dlga_destroy_lair_quest_brief:merchant_quest_track_bandit_lair_choice.4|Bandits such as these will usually set up their encampments in the woodland on the steppe, where they have some concealment. The best way to discover its location would be to find a group of steppe bandits who appear to be heading back to their base to resupply, and follow them.
dlga_destroy_lair_quest_brief:merchant_quest_track_bandit_lair_choice.5|Bandits such as these will usually set up their encampments deep in the woods. The best way to discover its location would be to find a group of tundra bandits who appear to be heading back to their base to resupply, and follow them.
dlga_merchant_quest_track_bandit_lair_choice:merchant_quest_destroy_lair_brief|Aye, I'll do it.
dlga_merchant_quest_track_bandit_lair_choice:lord_pretalk|I'm afraid I can't take the job at the moment.
dlga_merchant_quest_destroy_lair_brief:close_window|Very good. We will await word of your success.
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.1|We have heard that {s4}, some travellers on the road {reg4?to:from} {s5} were attacked by {s7}.
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:merchant_quest_track_bandits_choice|We would like you to track these {s4} down. The merchants of the town were able to get a description of their leader, and have put together a bounty. If you can hunt them down and destroy them, we'll make it worth your while...
dlga_merchant_quest_track_bandits_choice:merchant_quest_track_bandits_brief|Aye, I'll do it.
dlga_merchant_quest_track_bandits_brief:close_window|Very good. The band may not have lingered long in the area, but chances are that they will be spotted by other travellers on the road.
dlga_merchant_quest_track_bandits_choice:merchant_quest_stall|I'm afraid I can't take the job at the moment.
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.2|You're looking for a job? Actually I was looking for someone to deliver some {s4}. Perhaps you can do that...
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:merchant_quest_brief_deliver_wine|I have a cargo of {s6} that needs to be delivered to the tavern in {s4}. If you can take {reg5} units of {s6} to {s4} in 7 days, you may earn {reg8} crowns. What do you say?
dlga_merchant_quest_brief_deliver_wine:merchant_quest_taken|Alright. I will make the delivery.
dlga_merchant_quest_brief_deliver_wine:merchant_quest_stall|I am afraid I can't carry all that cargo now.
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.3|You're looking for a job? Actually I was looking for someone to escort a caravan. Perhaps you can do that...
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:escort_merchant_caravan_quest_brief|I am going to send a caravan of goods to {s8}. However with all those bandits and deserters on the roads, I don't want to send them out without an escort. If you can lead that caravan to {s8} in 15 days, you will earn {reg8} crowns. Of course your party needs to be at least {reg4} strong to offer them any protection.
dlga_escort_merchant_caravan_quest_brief:merchant_quest_taken|Alright. I will escort the caravan.
dlga_escort_merchant_caravan_quest_brief:merchant_quest_stall|I am afraid I don't have that many soldiers with me.
dlga_escort_merchant_caravan_quest_brief:merchant_quest_stall.1|Sorry. I can't do that right now
dlga_start:close_window.37|We can cover the rest of the way ourselves. Thanks.
dlga_start:close_window.38|Well, we have almost reached {s21}. We can cover the rest of the way ourselves. Here's your pay... {reg14} crowns. Thanks for escorting us. Good luck.
dlga_start:merchant_caravan_intro_1|Greetings. You must be our escort, right?
dlga_merchant_caravan_intro_1:merchant_caravan_intro_2|Yes. My name is {playername}. I will lead you to {s1}.
dlga_merchant_caravan_intro_2:escort_merchant_caravan_talk|Well, It is good to know we won't travel alone. What do you want us to do now?
dlga_start:escort_merchant_caravan_talk|Eh. We've made it this far... What do you want us to do?
dlga_escort_merchant_caravan_talk:merchant_caravan_follow_lead|You follow my lead. I'll take you through a safe route.
dlga_merchant_caravan_follow_lead:close_window|Alright. We'll be right behind you.
dlga_escort_merchant_caravan_talk:merchant_caravan_stay_here|You stay here for a while. I'll go ahead and check the road.
dlga_merchant_caravan_stay_here:close_window|Alright. We'll be waiting here for you.
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.4|Actually, I was looking for an able adventurer like you. There's this group of particularly troublesome bandits. They have infested the vicinity of our town and are preying on my caravans. They have avoided all the soldiers and the militias up to now. If someone doesn't stop them soon, I am going to be ruined...
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:troublesome_bandits_quest_brief|I will pay you {reg8} crowns if you hunt down those troublesome bandits. It's dangerous work. But I believe that you are the {man/one} for it. What do you say?
dlga_troublesome_bandits_quest_brief:merchant_quest_taken_bandits|Very well. I will hunt down those bandits.
dlga_merchant_quest_taken_bandits:close_window|You will? Splendid. Good luck to you.
dlga_troublesome_bandits_quest_brief:merchant_quest_stall|Sorry. I don't have time for this right now.
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.5|Actually, I was looking for a reliable {man/helper} that can undertake an important mission. A group of bandits have kidnapped the daughter of a friend of mine and are holding her for ransom. My friend is ready to pay them, but we still need someone to take the money to those rascals and bring the girl back to safety.
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:kidnapped_girl_quest_brief|The amount the bandits ask as ransom is {reg12} crowns. I will give you that money once you accept to take the quest. You have 15 days to take the money to the bandits who will be waiting near the village of {s4}. Those bastards said that they are going to kill the poor girl if they don't get the money by that time. You will get your pay of {reg8} crowns when you bring the girl safely back here.
dlga_kidnapped_girl_quest_brief:kidnapped_girl_quest_taken|All right. I will take the ransom money to the bandits and bring back the girl.
dlga_kidnapped_girl_quest_taken:close_window|Good. I knew we could trust you at this. Here is the ransom money, {reg12} crowns. Count it before taking it. And please, don't attempt to do anything rash. Keep in mind that the girl's well being is more important than anything else...
dlga_kidnapped_girl_quest_brief:merchant_quest_stall|Sorry. I don't have time for this right now.
dlga_start:close_window.39|Thank you so much for bringing me back!  I can't wait to see my family. Good-bye.

dlga_kidnapped_girl_liberated_battle_2a:kidnapped_girl_liberated_battle_2b|Unfortunately. You do not have room in your party for me.

dlga_start:bandits_awaiting_ransom_intro_1.1|You came back? Quick, give us the money now.
dlga_bandits_awaiting_ransom_intro_1:bandits_awaiting_ransom_pay|Here, take the money. Just set the girl free.
dlga_bandits_awaiting_ransom_pay:close_window|Heh. You've brought the money all right. You can take the girl now. It was a pleasure doing business with you...
dlga_bandits_awaiting_ransom_intro_1:bandits_awaiting_ransom_b|No way! You release the girl first.
dlga_bandits_awaiting_ransom_b:bandits_awaiting_ransom_b2|You fool! Stop playing games and give us the money! 
dlga_bandits_awaiting_ransom_b2:bandits_awaiting_ransom_pay|All right. Here's your money. Let the girl go now.
dlga_bandits_awaiting_ransom_b2:bandits_awaiting_ransom_no_money|I had left the money in a safe place. Let me go fetch it.
dlga_bandits_awaiting_ransom_no_money:close_window|Are you testing our patience or something?  Go and bring that money here quickly.
dlga_bandits_awaiting_ransom_b2:bandits_awaiting_ransom_fight|I have no intention to pay you anything. I demand that you release the girl now!
dlga_bandits_awaiting_ransom_fight:close_window|You won't be demanding anything when you're dead.
dlga_start:bandits_awaiting_remeet|What's it? You have given us the money. We have no more business.
dlga_bandits_awaiting_remeet:close_window|Sorry to bother you. I'll be on my way now.
dlga_bandits_awaiting_remeet:bandits_awaiting_remeet_2|We have one more business. You'll give the money back to me.
dlga_bandits_awaiting_remeet_2:close_window|Oh, that business! Of course. Let us get down to it.
dlga_start:kidnapped_girl_encounter_1|Oh {sir/madam}. Thank you so much for rescuing me. Will you take me to my family now?
dlga_kidnapped_girl_encounter_1:kidnapped_girl_join|Yes. Come with me. I'll take you home.
dlga_kidnapped_girl_join:close_window|Unfortunately. You do not have room in your party for me.
dlga_kidnapped_girl_join:close_window.1|Oh, thank you so much!

dlga_kidnapped_girl_wait:close_window|Oh, please {sir/madam}, do not leave me here all alone!
dlga_merchant_quest_about_job_2:lost_kidnapped_girl|Unfortunately I lost the girl on the way here...
dlga_lost_kidnapped_girl:lost_kidnapped_girl_2|Oh no! How am I going to tell this to my friend?
dlga_lost_kidnapped_girl_2:lost_kidnapped_girl_3|I'm sorry. I could do nothing about it.
dlga_lost_kidnapped_girl_3:lost_kidnapped_girl_4|You let me down {playername}. I had trusted you. I will let people know of your incompetence at this task. Also, I want back that {reg8} crowns I gave you as the ransom fee.
dlga_lost_kidnapped_girl_4:merchant_quest_about_job_5a|Of course. Here you are...
dlga_merchant_quest_about_job_5a:close_window|At least you have the decency to return the money.
dlga_lost_kidnapped_girl_4:merchant_quest_about_job_5b|Sorry. I don't have that amount with me.
dlga_merchant_quest_about_job_5b:close_window|Do you expect me to believe that? You are going to pay that ransom fee back! Go and bring the money now!
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_1|This war between {s15} and {s14} has brought our town to the verge of ruin. Our caravans get raided before they can reach their destination. Our merchants are afraid to leave the safety of the town walls. And as if those aren't enough, the taxes to maintain the war take away the last bits of our savings. If peace does not come soon, we can not hold on for much longer.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_1:merchant_quest_brief|You are right. But who can stop this madness called war?
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_1:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_reject|It is your duty to help the nobles in their war effort. You shouldn't complain about it.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_reject:close_window|Hah. The nobles fight their wars for their greed and their dreams of glory. And it is poor honest folk like us who have to bear the real burden. But you obviously don't want to hear about that.
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_3|There have been attempts to reconcile the two sides and reach a settlement. However, there are powerful lords on both sides whose interests lie in continuing the war. These men urge all others not to heed to the word of sensible men, but to keep fighting. While these leaders remain influential, no peace settlement can be reached.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_3:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_4|Who are these warmongers who block the way of peace?
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_3:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_4.1|Who are these lords you speak of?
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_4:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_5|They are {s12} from {s15} and {s13} from {s14}. Until they change their mind or lose their influence, there will be no chance of having peace between the two sides.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_5:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_6|What can be done about this?
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_5:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_6.1|Alas, it seems nothing can be done about it.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_6:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_7|There is a way to resolve the issue. A particularly determined person can perhaps persuade one or both of these lords to accept making peace. And even if that fails, it can be possible to see that these lords are defeated by force and taken prisoner. If they are captive, they will lose their influence and they can no longer oppose a settlement... What do you think? Can you do it?
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_7:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_8|It seems difficult. But I will try.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_7:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_8.1|If the price is right, I may.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_7:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_8.2|Forget it. This is not my problem.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_8:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_9|Most of the merchants in the town will gladly open up their purses to support such a plan. I think we can collect {reg12} crowns between ourselves. We will be happy to reward you with that sum, if you can work this out. Convince {s12} and {s13} to accept a peace settlement, and if either of them proves too stubborn, make sure he falls captive and can not be ransomed until a peace deal is settled.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_9:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_10|All right. I will do my best.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_9:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_no|Sorry. I can not do this.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_10:close_window|Excellent. You will have our blessings. I hope you can deal with those two old goats. We will be waiting and hoping for the good news.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_no:close_window|Don't say no right away. Think about this for some time. If there is a {man/lady} who can manage to do this, it is you.
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_deal_with_night_bandits|Do I indeed! There's a group of bandits infesting the town, and I'm at the end of my rope as to how to deal with them. They've been ambushing and robbing townspeople under the cover of night, and then fading away quick as lightning when the guards finally show up. We've not been able to catch a one of them. They only attack lone people, never daring to show themselves when there's a group about. I need someone who can take on these bandits alone and win. That seems to be the only way of bringing them to justice. Are you up to the task?

dlga_merchant_quest_deal_with_night_bandits:merchant_quest_stall|My apologies, I'm not interested.
dlga_deal_with_night_bandits_quest_taken:mayor_pretalk|That takes a weight off my shoulders, {playername}. You can expect a fine reward if you come back successful. Just don't get yourself killed, eh?
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.6|One of the merchants here is looking for herdsmen to take his cattle to the market at {s13}.
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:move_cattle_herd_quest_brief|The cattle herd must be at {s13} within 30 days. Sooner is better, much better, but it must be absolutely no later than 30 days. If you can do that, I'd be willing to pay you {reg8} crowns for your trouble. Interested?
dlga_move_cattle_herd_quest_brief:move_cattle_herd_quest_taken|Aye, I can take the herd to {s13}.
dlga_move_cattle_herd_quest_brief:merchant_quest_stall|I am sorry, but no.
dlga_move_cattle_herd_quest_taken:mayor_pretalk|Splendid. You can find the herd right outside the town. After you take the animals to {s13}, return back to me and I will give you your pay.
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:mayor_pretalk|I am afraid I can't offer you a job right now.
dlga_start:village_elder_deliver_cattle_thank|My good {sir/madam}. Our village is grateful for your help. Thanks to the {reg5} heads of cattle you have brought, we can now raise our own herd.
dlga_village_elder_deliver_cattle_thank:village_elder_talk|My good {lord/lady}, please, is there anything I can do for you?
dlga_start:brac_starts|What do you want?
dlga_brac_starts:close_window|I'm just passing.
dlga_start:brac_startq|Who goes there?
dlga_brac_startq:close_window|Do not pay attention to me.
dlga_start:brac_start|Who goes there?
dlga_brac_start:brac_start2|Stop poaching and return to plowing your fields.
dlga_brac_start2:brac_start3|If we don't hunt game then we will starve, the lord does not leave us enough groceries and never any meat. Don't you like meat too? Maybe we can work something out, you could look the other away. What do you think?
dlga_brac_start3:close_window|I understand... I could say I haven't seen you.
dlga_brac_start3:brac_sfight|Lies... poaching allows you to pay for your drinking, besides I do not like your ugly face.
dlga_brac_sfight:close_window|Die!
dlga_start:bracon_village_finwin|Well, any news about poachers?
dlga_bracon_village_finwin:bracon_village_finwin2|There are no poachers in your forest for the time being, so you can rest easy.
dlga_bracon_village_finwin2:village_elder_pretalk|Music to my ears, thank you a thousand times, my lord. As promised here are your fresh provisions. I hope you come back soon to patrol the forest. These villains are a recurring problem, you know.
dlga_start:bracon_village_finfail|Well, any news about poachers?
dlga_bracon_village_finfail:bracon_village_finfail2|I have to admit I've underestimated these farmers. There were about thirty and it proved impossible to fight them on my own.
dlga_bracon_village_finfail2:village_elder_pretalk|Really? But... our village doesn't even have as many people, they must come from elsewhere for sure...
dlga_start:bracon_village_elder_talk|Welcome {s9}. Forgive me, but can I ask you for a favor?
dlga_bracon_village_elder_talk:bracon_village_elder_talksuite|Certainly.
dlga_bracon_village_elder_talk:bracon_village_elder_talkfail|I'm sorry but I have no time.
dlga_bracon_village_elder_talkfail:village_elder_talk|Well, what do you want?
dlga_bracon_village_elder_talksuite:village_elder_suite2|I'm concerned about the surrounding forest, which is owned by our lord. It's being constantly emptied of its game by poachers. As you probably know it is forbidden for a serf to hunt on the lands of his lord. I don't know who engages in this activity although I have some ideas. I know especially that I may be ousted by my lord if I can't find a solution. Anyway we want to hire guards to watch over the forest and game. Do you want the job? We're authorized to give out provisions in return for your service.
dlga_village_elder_suite2:village_elder_suitequestgo|For provisions? It's ok, I'll patrol your forest.
dlga_village_elder_suitequestgo:village_elder_pretalk|Understood, thank you. Just follow the trail in the forest. Whether you find poachers or not you've have done the patrol and therefore will get the reward.
dlga_village_elder_suite2:bracon_village_elder_talkfail|I don't have the time to patrol the forest.
dlga_start:village_elder_talk|Good day, {sir/madam}, and welcome to {s9}. I am the elder of this village.
dlga_start:village_elder_talk.1|Welcome to {s9}, my {lord/lady}. We were rejoiced by the news that you are the new {lord/lady} of our humble village. I am the village elder and I will be honoured to serve you in any way I can.

dlga_start:village_elder_talk.3|Good day, {sir/madam}.
dlga_village_elder_pretalk:village_elder_talk|Is there anything else I can do for you?
dlga_village_elder_talk:maconique_village_questions|I'm interested in the history of this town, can I ask you a few questions?
dlga_maconique_village_questions:maconique_village_questions3|Really? I can help you... I guess it's the castle that interests you?
dlga_maconique_village_questions3:maconique_village_chateau|Tell me about the history of this castle.
dlga_maconique_village_questions3:maconique_village_oeil|I'd like to take a look at the old castle, can you take me?
dlga_maconique_village_questions3:maconique_village_hallbard|Do you know the old lord of this village? His coat of arms has a lion holding a halberd sitting on a throne...
dlga_maconique_village_questions3:close_window|That's all for the moment.
dlga_maconique_village_hallbard:maconique_village_hallbardsuit|It may be that Godfrey of Villieux didn't have offspring when he died in the crusades around 1200. The king must have given the land to new lords. I don't see what more there is to say.
dlga_maconique_village_hallbardsuit:maconique_village_hallbardsuit2|Would you know anything about his friends and enemies, that kind of stuff?
dlga_maconique_village_hallbardsuit2:maconique_village_questions3|Absolutely nothing. Can I do anything more for you?
dlga_maconique_village_chateau:maconique_village_questions3|You won't find many people to talk about it. They say the castle is haunted by Godfrey himself. People here are simple and very superstitious. I don't believe in these stories, but at the same time I shouldn't get too close either. You know what I mean? Do you want something else? 
dlga_maconique_village_oeil:maconique_village_oeil2|It's forbidden to enter, but if it's really important to you, I can make a request to my lord for a permission... or not, I'm sorry.
dlga_maconique_village_oeil2:maconique_village_hallbardsuit3|There must be another way, maybe if you agreed to pick up a purse I just drop by inadvertently, keep its contents and open up the door just after that.
dlga_maconique_village_hallbardsuit3:maconique_village_hallbardsuit4|And... this purse would contain exactly how much?
dlga_maconique_village_hallbardsuit4:maconique_village_cinq|10 crowns
dlga_maconique_village_hallbardsuit4:maconique_village_cinq.1|50 crowns
dlga_maconique_village_hallbardsuit4:maconique_village_cent|100 crowns
dlga_maconique_village_hallbardsuit4:close_window|I don't have enough gold.
dlga_maconique_village_cinq:close_window|This must be a joke? I'm not interested.
dlga_maconique_village_cent:maconique_village_centok|It's okay, I'll open the door discretely. You are solely responsible for what happens to you on the other side of the wall. So do not come complaining when you get killed... I mean...
dlga_maconique_village_centok:maconique_village_centfin|Yes, I understand. Just open that door now.
dlga_maconique_village_centok:close_window|Good, I'll come back later.
dlga_maconique_village_centfin:close_window|As you wish, I don't even want to know what you saw there.

dlga_vendeur_cheuv_pretalk:vendeur_cheuv_start|My pleasure.
dlga_vendeur_cheuv_start:close_window|I have to hit the road...
dlga_start:refugie_femme_off|You are our guardian angel, the grace of the Lord be upon you.
dlga_refugie_femme_off:close_window|Thank you, my dear.
dlga_start:refugie_femme_on|We are living in conditions resembling hell on earth, please have mercy.
dlga_refugie_femme_on:close_window|Never fear, my dear.
dlga_start:refugie_off|Again, thank you to our savior.
dlga_refugie_off:close_window|Mind you both.
dlga_start:refugie_in|Welcome back, thank you enough.
dlga_refugie_in:refugie_dont|Here are some groceries to keep you fed for a while.
dlga_refugie_in:close_window|It's nothing, take care of yourself.
dlga_refugie_dont:close_window|You are our savior, what can we do for you in return... I'm a craftsman. Take these plans that have no use for me at the moment, maybe they will be helpful.
dlga_start:refugie_out|We will go, is it not what you want?
dlga_refugie_out:close_window|You have to leave, nothing personal.
dlga_start:refugie_manoir|Who are you? What do you want?
dlga_refugie_manoir:refugie_manoir2|What are you doing here? The innkeeper sent me to investigate noises, noises that you are the cause for without question.
dlga_refugie_manoir2:refugie_manoir3|We fled the massacres in our village, walked without stopping. Now we're exhausted and don't know where my wife and I should go. I implore you to have mercy on us.
dlga_refugie_manoir3:refugie_manoirbon|I understand, stay here but be discreet or the landlord will send mercenaries. They won't be asking questions. Instead they will set the mansion on fire along with two fresh corpses.
dlga_refugie_manoir3:refugie_manoirmauvais|You can't stay, if I come back tomorrow and you're still here, you'll witness another massacre.
dlga_refugie_manoirmauvais:close_window|Well... as you like, we leave on the spot.
dlga_refugie_manoirbon:refugie_manoirbonsuit|Thank you... thank you, rest assured, we won't make any noise.
dlga_refugie_manoirbonsuit:manoir_survie|How do you manage to survive here?
dlga_refugie_manoirbonsuit:close_window|Well, I trust you.
dlga_manoir_survie:refugie_manoirbonsuit2|We hide during the day and go out at night to feed us from the garbage of the inn. Sometimes I manage to catch a fish that we need to eat raw. We don't know where to go, we are lost and penniless.
dlga_refugie_manoirbonsuit2:close_window|You should go to town and find a job, you just have to evade the brigands on your way in. Good luck.
dlga_start:hobelar_ready|What are your orders?
dlga_hobelar_ready:close_window|Prepare, we ride at dawn.
dlga_start:hobelar_start_start|Do you need mercenaries? {reg3} Me and my companions are looking for a master. We will join you for {reg5} crowns.
dlga_hobelar_start_start:hobelar_start_spec|Can you tell me more about your combat skills?
dlga_hobelar_start_spec:hobelar_start_start|We are Hobelars, light horsemen on fast horses. We take your enemies by surprise from behind. We hound the fugitives and round up prisoners.
dlga_hobelar_start_start:hobelar_recrut|Fine, I'll hire the whole lot of you. Here's {reg5} crowns.
dlga_hobelar_start_start:close_window|Currently, I can not afford to hire additional men.
dlga_hobelar_recrut:hobelar_recrut2|What are your orders?
dlga_hobelar_recrut2:close_window|Prepare, we ride at dawn.
dlga_start:hacheur_ready|What are your orders?
dlga_hacheur_ready:close_window|Get ready, we leave at dawn.
dlga_start:hacheur_start_start|Do you need mercenaries? {reg4} Me and my companions are looking for a master. We will join you for {reg6} crowns.
dlga_hacheur_start_start:hacheur_start_start_spec|Can you tell me more about your combat skills?
dlga_hacheur_start_start_spec:hacheur_start_start|We are lumberjacks. With our axes we can easily break shields and then just as easily the bones behind them. Which is the reason why some also call us butchers.
dlga_hacheur_start_start:hacheur_recrut|Snap, I'll hire everyone. Here's {reg6} crowns.
dlga_hacheur_start_start:close_window|Currently, I can not afford to hire additional men.
dlga_hacheur_recrut:hacheur_recrut2|What are your orders?
dlga_hacheur_recrut2:close_window|Get ready, we leave at dawn.
dlga_start:aubergmessager_start|Finally some rest, right? I'm a messenger and I spend my days galloping around like a madman. How about a small game?
dlga_aubergmessager_start:aubergmessager_start_game|Why not.
dlga_aubergmessager_start:close_window|No time for that.
dlga_aubergmessager_start_game:generique_des|Here we go then, what are we playing?
dlga_start:jouteur_aub_start|Hello, you're in the area?
dlga_jouteur_aub_start:jouteur_aub_start2|I could say that, if I remained more than three days in one place. You?
dlga_jouteur_aub_start:close_window|Not at all, farewell.
dlga_jouteur_aub_start2:jouteur_aub_start3|I'm from the south, but I run tournaments across France. That is how I make my living.
dlga_jouteur_aub_start3:jouteur_aub_start4|Really? I do some occasional jousting as well, do you have any tips?
dlga_jouteur_aub_start3:close_window|Really? Well, good luck.
dlga_jouteur_aub_start4:jouteur_aub_start5|Well... okay, as long as you pay my drink.
dlga_jouteur_aub_start5:jouteur_aub_startpay|Of course, what can you tell me?
dlga_jouteur_aub_start5:close_window|Unfortunately I'm broke.
dlga_jouteur_aub_startpay:jouteur_aub_end|Okay, first there's the matter of distance and timing. You should anticipate the shot. Movement will provide the energy, not the thrust. Don't aim directly to the armor of the competitor but a little to the left. If it's too much to the left or if you release too early, victory will elude you. Of course be careful to not hit the head of the horse, or we will talk about you and your clumsiness for a long time.
dlga_jouteur_aub_end:close_window|Very interesting, maybe we will cross the lances in the future. Who knows, my thanks.
dlga_start:payjoy_start|I offer you a glass, stranger. After three catastrophic seasons and the disease that struck my animals we finally had a harvest worthy of the name.
dlga_payjoy_start:payjoy_start2|What caused the crop failures?
dlga_payjoy_start:close_window|It's very nice of you, goodbye.
dlga_payjoy_start2:close_window|The weather, a plague swept away many of my workers. The war, because of that whole fields have been burned, and naturally the scourge of God...
dlga_start:med_auberge|Greetings stranger, are you all right?
dlga_med_auberge:med_auberge2|Why does it matter?
dlga_med_auberge:close_window|Perfect as always, farewell.
dlga_med_auberge2:med_auberge3|I'm a doctor and I see that you are covered with wounds, some of which have not healed. If you want I can take care of it, but it will cost money of course.
dlga_med_auberge3:med_auberge_tete|I have a head injury, do something please.
dlga_med_auberge3:med_auberge_bras|I have an arm injury, can you do something?
dlga_med_auberge3:med_auberge_jambe|I have a leg injury, can you do something?
dlga_med_auberge_tete:med_auberge_tete2|Dear lord! How are you still alive? We must close this horrible wound before it gets infected. It will cost you 200 crowns, please.
dlga_med_auberge_tete2:med_auberge_tete3|Okay, here's the money, hurry, the pain is unbearable.
dlga_med_auberge_tete2:med_auberge3s|I do not have the amount you request.
dlga_med_auberge3s:med_auberge3|I'm sorry, but I can't do anything in that case. I need money to pay for the drugs.
dlga_med_auberge_tete3:med_auberge3|Well, be careful next time. Eventually you'll run out of luck.
dlga_med_auberge_bras:med_auberge_bras2|Indeed, your arm is a mess, it'll cost 100 crowns for the care.
dlga_med_auberge_bras2:med_auberge_bras3|Okay, here's the money, hurry, I can barely move the arm.
dlga_med_auberge_bras2:med_auberge_bras2s|I do not have the amount you request.
dlga_med_auberge_bras2s:med_auberge3|I'm sorry, but I can't do anything in that case.
dlga_med_auberge_bras3:med_auberge3|Well, be careful next time or your arm might fall off.
dlga_med_auberge_jambe:med_auberge_jambe2|It's not serious. However you must clean the wound and change the bandage regularly. Ointments and bandages will cost 50 crowns, please.
dlga_med_auberge_jambe2:med_auberge_jambe3|Okay, here's the money, hurry, I can barely stand.
dlga_med_auberge_jambe2:med_auberge_jambe2s|I do not have the amount you request.
dlga_med_auberge_jambe2s:med_auberge3|I'm sorry, but I can't do anything in that case.
dlga_med_auberge_jambe3:med_auberge3|I recommend you to be more careful. No-one wants a captain who can't walk.
dlga_med_auberge3:med_auberge_no|It will do for now, thank you.
dlga_med_auberge_no:close_window|As you wish, but don't forget to treat yourself if you are injured.
dlga_start:hivrey_fini_cheval|Cursed... walking horse steak!
dlga_hivrey_fini_cheval:close_window|Nice to see you too.
dlga_start:hivrey_quete_cheval_end|Cursed horse...
dlga_hivrey_quete_cheval_end:hivrey_quete_cheval_end2|Always walking I see... and a bottle as a companion.
dlga_hivrey_quete_cheval_end:hivrey_quete_cheval_end3|I found your horse and kept it. I'll pay your drink for compensation.
dlga_hivrey_quete_cheval_end2:close_window|Yes, at least my mug is unlikely to escape.
dlga_hivrey_quete_cheval_end3:close_window|What?! It's not at all about the money. But on the other hand, how could I refuse a mug?
dlga_start:hivrey_attente_cheval|Cursed... walking horse steak!
dlga_hivrey_attente_cheval:close_window|Nice to see you too.
dlga_start:hivrey_start|Don't approach me cursed horse... oh, you'll laugh. I bought a horse yesterday and he refused to go so I had to make my journey on foot. If I could catch it would already be on my plate. 
dlga_hivrey_start:hivrey_start2|And where is it now?
dlga_hivrey_start:close_window|Drink all you want, it doesn't bring you a new horse.
dlga_hivrey_start2:hivrey_start3|Who?
dlga_hivrey_start3:hivrey_start4|The horse.
dlga_hivrey_start4:close_window|Cursed horse, I left it in the meadows around Bourges. To think that I paid a fortune for it...
dlga_start:aub_musi_start|Traveller, do you value my music?
dlga_aub_musi_start:aub_musi_end|Indeed. This is for you, one denar.
dlga_aub_musi_start:close_window|Certainly.
dlga_aub_musi_start:close_window.1|How do you expect us to cook in such a noise, get out.
dlga_aub_musi_end:close_window|Thank you.
dlga_start:chev_camap_barder| 
dlga_chev_camap_barder:close_window|This cover is perfect, I hope it is not too heavy. You seem tired, but don't worry.
dlga_start:chev_camap| 
dlga_chev_camap:close_window|Softly my friend. I should go see a horse seller to buy armor for this horse.
dlga_start:chev_quete| 
dlga_chev_quete:close_window|Softly my friend. I should go see a horse seller to buy armor for this horse.
dlga_start:volont_camps_dial|{playername}, I'd like you to know that I aspire to return to my village in the Lorges forest alive. I'd follow you to the end... but your battles might not be mine.
dlga_volont_camps_dial:volont_camps_dial2|Either way, you get to go home soon.
dlga_volont_camps_dial:close_window|I still need you my friend.
dlga_volont_camps_dial2:close_window|Thank you.
dlga_start:volont_camps_dialautre|Yes? Are you going to ask me to rub your armor? In that case the answer is no, thank you.
dlga_volont_camps_dialautre:close_window|That's a great idea, I'll think about it later.
dlga_volont_camps_dialautre:close_window.1|Absolutely not, if you relax, what do you think?
dlga_start:volont_camps_nouv|{playername}, I think I want to stay with you for awhile. I realized that there's money to be made in your company. I expect to get my share of the spoils.
dlga_volont_camps_nouv:volont_camps_nouv2|I'm sorry, but you'll have to settle for the weekly wage like other soldiers.
dlga_volont_camps_nouv:close_window|You wouldn't happen to need a man of arms by any chance?
dlga_volont_camps_nouv2:close_window|Well... I'll take what I need from the corpses you leave in your path in this case, with your permission... or not.
dlga_start:volont_camps_dialnne|{playername}, you know, being constantly on the road isn't really what I had planned for my retirement.
dlga_volont_camps_dialnne:volont_camps_dialnne2|In that case, you are free to go.
dlga_volont_camps_dialnne:close_window|I still need you my friend.
dlga_volont_camps_dialnne2:close_window|Despite that, I'll stay. Soldier must meet his death on the battlefield. What I miss the most is having a drink among comrades after a fight. At that moment one truly feels alive.
dlga_start:pays_aubermaventire|What do we do now?
dlga_pays_aubermaventire:pays_aubermaventire_retour|Let's see your equipment.
dlga_pays_aubermaventire:pays_aubermaventire_skill|We should talk about what you should do in combat.
dlga_pays_aubermaventire:close_window|I'll get it, don't worry.
dlga_pays_aubermaventire_skill:pays_aubermaventire_retour|In combat? Well... poking the enemy with the tip of my weapon and running. That's about all I'm capable of.
dlga_pays_aubermaventire_retour:pays_aubermaventire|Anything else?
dlga_start:quete_volpays_aubermine|We are grateful to you for what you did.
dlga_quete_volpays_aubermine:quete_volpays_aubermine2|I need volunteers to do help me deal with these scoundrels. We'll descend into the mine, join us and let's get this over with.
dlga_quete_volpays_aubermine:close_window|It was nothing.
dlga_quete_volpays_aubermine2:close_window|My brother is stuck downstairs with the brutes, no need to say more. I'll follow you.
dlga_start:pays_aubermine|Whoever is going to help you out of pity?
dlga_pays_aubermine:close_window|I'll deal with it, do not worry.
dlga_start:brandon_recruit_aventure|Watch your back especially.
dlga_brandon_recruit_aventure:brandon_recruit_aventuresuspic|Remember to do that yourself. Or should I watch yours?
dlga_brandon_recruit_aventuresuspic:brandon_recruit_aventure|You could sleep in a middle of a meadow and have nothing to fear.
dlga_brandon_recruit_aventure:brandon_recruit_retour|Show me your equipment.
dlga_brandon_recruit_aventure:brandon_recruit__skill|We should talk about your combat tactics.
dlga_brandon_recruit_aventure:brandon_recruit_end|On the way.
dlga_brandon_recruit_end:close_window|After you.
dlga_brandon_recruit__skill:brandon_recruit_retour|Need to learn from a real fighter?
dlga_brandon_recruit_retour:brandon_recruit_aventure|Have you finished searching through my things? Good...
dlga_start:brandon_recruit_quetmine|Who are you? And what are you doing with me? Leave immediately.
dlga_brandon_recruit_quetmine:brandon_recruit_quetmine2|I need volunteers to fight the troops of the de Penthièvre. Will you join us?
dlga_brandon_recruit_quetmine:close_window|Well I'm going. My apologies.
dlga_brandon_recruit_quetmine2:brandon_recruit_quetmine3|So you aren't one of them like I thought... well, that's okay. I'm with you, provided that we are numerous enough to defeat them.
dlga_brandon_recruit_quetmine3:brandon_recruit_quetmine4|Are you a warrior?
dlga_brandon_recruit_quetmine4:brandon_recruit_quetmine5|More or less. I'm a mercenary, I was sent on a mission in the forest by the Duke in person. Having no money and no way to finish my mission I stopped walking around in circles. I ended up accepting a wine pot from these soldiers to not stick my nose in their business. But I went back to see if the situation had changed and if I could complete my contract.
dlga_brandon_recruit_quetmine5:brandon_recruit_quetmine6|Let's negotiate, I'll receive the biggest share of the reward from the Duke?
dlga_brandon_recruit_quetmine6:brandon_recruit_quetmine7|Of course... if you live to collect it. Otherwise I just have to introduce myself alone to the Duke.
dlga_brandon_recruit_quetmine7:close_window|And after the events take place, only one return to the survivor road.
dlga_start:brandon_prem_maison|Who are you? And what are you doing with me? Leave immediately.
dlga_brandon_prem_maison:close_window|Well, I'm going. My apologies.
dlga_start:fix_dialcg|That's ok, pass ahead.
dlga_fix_dialcg:close_window|Ok, let's go.
dlga_start:coupe_gorge_recruit_aventure|Did you hear that noise?
dlga_coupe_gorge_recruit_aventure:coupe_gorge_recruit_aventurenop|What noise?
dlga_coupe_gorge_recruit_aventurenop:coupe_gorge_recruit_aventure|I know... a crossbow that is being used to hunt deer...
dlga_coupe_gorge_recruit_aventure:coupe_gorge_recruit_retour|Let me see your equipment.
dlga_coupe_gorge_recruit_aventure:coupe_gorge_recruit_skill|We should talk about battle tactics.
dlga_coupe_gorge_recruit_aventure:close_window|Let's go.
dlga_coupe_gorge_recruit_skill:coupe_gorge_recruit_retour|And well what? I am an archer. Usually I just intimidate, sometimes I draw an arrow in front of a guard. I'm not really much of a swordsman if that's what you thought.
dlga_coupe_gorge_recruit_retour:coupe_gorge_recruit_aventure|Move.
dlga_start:cgorge_premdial_prem_maison|Don't move or I'll pierce you with my arrow. Drop your gold and your equipment, the same goes to you.
dlga_cgorge_premdial_prem_maison:cgorge_premdial_prem_maison2|Moment, are you with the de Penthièvre?
dlga_cgorge_premdial_prem_maison2:cgorge_premdial_prem_maison3|What's the difference? You give what you have on you. If you really want to know, I'm with myself and I'll pierce your tongue if you do not hurry up.
dlga_cgorge_premdial_prem_maison3:cgorge_premdial_prem_maison4|Fire if you want, but that won't help you to get rid of the armored troops that prevent passengers passing through here? You could help me to take them out and then I'll give you gold, what do you think?
dlga_cgorge_premdial_prem_maison4:cgorge_premdial_prem_maison5|You make sense. Me and the iron coats are not on very friendly terms. But if you lead me into a trap from which I come away alive, I won't give you another opportunity to open your mouth.
dlga_cgorge_premdial_prem_maison5:cgorge_premdial_prem_maison6|There is no catch, just a proposal. These troops have no business being here so we are kind of in the same boat.
dlga_cgorge_premdial_prem_maison6:close_window|Hmm... let's see.
dlga_start:fixartus_recruit_quetmine|Attention, that's them.
dlga_fixartus_recruit_quetmine:close_window|Do you know what to do?
dlga_artus_recruit_quetmine2:artus_recruit_quetmine3|An expedition you say? Do I at least have a chance to make money from the iron coats? Or do you just want to send me to my death for no reason?
dlga_start:artus_recruit_aventure|Are you all right? I'm a doctor.
dlga_artus_recruit_aventure:artus_recruit_emo|Stop the bleeding, please.
dlga_artus_recruit_emo:artus_recruit_aventure|Nothing too bad, I've never seen a soldier that couldn't stand the sight of blood. You'll get better soon.
dlga_artus_recruit_aventure:artus_recruit_aventure_retour|Show me your equipment.
dlga_artus_recruit_aventure:artus_recruit_aventure_skill|We should talk about your combat tactics.
dlga_artus_recruit_aventure:close_window|Continue
dlga_artus_recruit_aventure_skill:artus_recruit_aventure_retour|Fight? The only fights I've fought are those where I'm armed with a saw doing amputation on some unconscious patients...
dlga_artus_recruit_aventure_retour:artus_recruit_aventure|Are you finished?
dlga_start:artus_recruit_quetmine|What are you doing?
dlga_artus_recruit_quetmine:artus_recruit_quetmine2|I need volunteers to fight the troops of the de Penthièvre. Whoever you are, will you join me for an expedition down to the mines?
dlga_artus_recruit_quetmine3:artus_recruit_quetmine4|We have a chance.
dlga_artus_recruit_quetmine4:artus_recruit_quetmine6|Well... the iron coats killed my wife and my daughter. Help me to kill this patrol and I'm all yours.
dlga_artus_recruit_quetmine6:close_window|No wait, no need to...
dlga_start:chef_aubergmiine|What? Who gave you permission to enter, who are you?
dlga_chef_aubergmiine:chef_aubergmiine2|The guard at the gate told me you'd have work for a mercenary.
dlga_chef_aubergmiine:close_window|I didn't want to disturb you, I'm leaving now.
dlga_chef_aubergmiine2:chef_aubergmiine3|Really? Well... it's true that we lack the guys to watch everyone?
dlga_chef_aubergmiine3:chef_aubergmiine4|I'm on the lookout for opportunities. What's happening here?
dlga_chef_aubergmiine4:chef_aubergmiine5|You think I know everything? Just prevent the villagers from leaving the village and maybe we'll have a pint and some dried meat for you.
dlga_chef_aubergmiine5:chef_aubergmiine6|Why keep them from leaving?
dlga_chef_aubergmiine6:chef_aubergmiine7|Are you're deaf? You do what you're told, are we clear?
dlga_chef_aubergmiine5:close_window|Regardless, I have to talk to the butler... in private. [attack]
dlga_chef_aubergmiine7:close_window|In that case I prefer to leave, but I'll be back.
dlga_start:intauberr_gard|What are you doing around here? Who told you to come?
dlga_intauberr_gard:close_window|That was your friend at the door, he told me that you are hiring.
dlga_start:intauberr_gard2|Who told you to go rogue?
dlga_intauberr_gard2:close_window|Your friend that's posted at the door, he told me that there was work for me.
dlga_start:intauberr_gard3|What are you doing here, stranger?
dlga_intauberr_gard3:close_window|Your friend at the door, he told me that the chief would have work for me.
dlga_start:ruedame_comte_sauf|My God, this is unbearable.
dlga_ruedame_comte_sauf:ruedame_comte_sauf2|Nothing to fear, my lord.
dlga_ruedame_comte_sauf2:close_window|Okay, I'll go inside, you can go now.
dlga_start:ruedame_gardestart2|This is insane! What do you want now, clown?
dlga_ruedame_gardestart2:ruedame_gardestart3|Forgive me Lord, but what should I expect?
dlga_ruedame_gardestart3:close_window|Well, well, well, what do we have here? Fool, you simply have to wait for another soldier to relieve you.
dlga_start:ruedame_gardestart|Are you here for guard duty, soldier? Go to the gate and prevent anyone from entering and ensure no-one with rude manners disturbs.
dlga_ruedame_gardestart:close_window|Understood, my lord.
dlga_start:ruedame_peuple_collere|I have more weapons. What, do you want more? In your place I'd be ashamed to work for that bastard count.
dlga_ruedame_peuple_collere:close_window|...
dlga_start:ruedame_peuple_arme|What, what do you want?
dlga_ruedame_peuple_arme:ruedame_peuple_arme2|You carry that sword poorly, I'd rather you give it to me or risk injury.
dlga_ruedame_peuple_arme2:ruedame_peuple_arme3|I don't take orders from anyone, neither the Count or his dogs.
dlga_ruedame_peuple_arme3:ruedame_peuple_armecada|I may as well pick it up from your corpse.
dlga_ruedame_peuple_arme3:close_window|Okay, keep it.
dlga_ruedame_peuple_armecada:close_window|Okay, here it is, I hope you cut yourself with it.
dlga_start:ruedame_peuple_colleresui|It's a shame! The Duke expects to see scoundrels arrested, but the Count only thinks about drinking and carousing with our tax money.
dlga_ruedame_peuple_colleresui:close_window|I have nothing to do with your Count.
dlga_start:ruedame_peuple_colleresui2|Long live the Duke of Brittany! Death to traitors, like the Count.
dlga_ruedame_peuple_colleresui2:ruedame_peuple_colleresui22|Try not to cause trouble while I'm on duty.
dlga_ruedame_peuple_colleresui22:close_window|By letting things get worse the Duke finds himself surrounded by enemies. If I were you I would pierce the Count with my spear. For the Duke!
dlga_start:ruedame_peuple_suitt|Long live the Duke of Brittany! Death to the traitors!
dlga_ruedame_peuple_suitt:close_window|I do not want to be involved in that.
dlga_start:ruedame_peuple_dernier|Look at this baronet prancing around in fancy clothes, a real court whore.
dlga_ruedame_peuple_dernier:close_window|Yet you do not have to breathe her fragrance.
dlga_start:ruedame_derangepoint|Do not bother us, gauche.
dlga_ruedame_derangepoint:close_window|Forgive me, monsieur.
dlga_start:cdf_camp_relever|Do you know when the relief arrives?
dlga_cdf_camp_relever:cdf_camp_relever2|How long does the siege take?
dlga_cdf_camp_relever2:cdf_camp_relever3|A siege like this? It can last for months, in the meantime we don't need to work and the bowl is filled every night... it's nice.

dlga_cdf_camp_relever4:close_window|Why don't you leave and come back at the end of the siege? It wouldn't be the first time.
dlga_start:cdf_camp_entrer|Hey friend, if you were to go into the citadel now, how would you get there?
dlga_cdf_camp_entrer:cdf_camp_entrer2|I don't know.
dlga_cdf_camp_entrer2:cdf_camp_entrer3|Me... I'd go over the wall. A good grappling-iron and a rope would do. I would enter at night...
dlga_cdf_camp_entrer3:cdf_camp_entrer4|And...?
dlga_cdf_camp_entrer4:close_window|And well... shit! What do you want me to do? Even if I could get de Penthièvre, it's still not enough for me to be willing to get killed.
dlga_start:cdf_camp_bpoue|Are you part of the army of the Duke? The one that will relieve us from this pile of mud?
dlga_cdf_camp_bpoue:close_window|I'm afraid not.
dlga_start:cdf_camp_campagne|Where do you hail from, friend? This is the first time we meet and I have served in almost all of the company's campaigns.
dlga_cdf_camp_campagne:close_window|Here and there, I really haven't got a home.
dlga_start:cdf_camp_entendu|Have you heard of the bounty on de Penthièvre's head?
dlga_cdf_camp_entendu:cdf_camp_entendu2|It's possible.
dlga_cdf_camp_entendu2:close_window|Of course you've heard. Mind if I ask you how to trap this game and bring it to the Duke as a trophy?
dlga_start:cdf_camp_idee|When I think of the bounty and the bastard housed in his castle, it's like juicy serving of game and ale were hidden just behind a locked door. We can smell but not grab them.
dlga_cdf_camp_idee:cdf_camp_idee2|Instead, we are left with the check.
dlga_cdf_camp_idee2:close_window|Hmm... I don't know. If it was up to me, I'd go in there and start a massacre, considering all things we could take - not forgetting the women trapped in there.
dlga_start:cdf_camp_dialtroopmarche|It's better to idle than bust your ass off, right?
dlga_cdf_camp_dialtroopmarche:cdf_camp_dialtroopmarche2|The best is to grab a wench after a good meal.
dlga_cdf_camp_dialtroopmarche2:close_window|Not before the paycheck, my friend.
dlga_start:cdf_camp_dialtroopautre|This insolent de Penthièvre, the least he could do is to catch a disease of death from the breeze, so we could all go home.
dlga_cdf_camp_dialtroopautre:close_window|Something tells me you get back home early.
dlga_start:cdf_camp_dialtroop|It's cold, damp and miserable. Damn, why did we came here?
dlga_cdf_camp_dialtroop:close_window|Merc life is a breeze, you have plenty of time to kill and then you go and kill someone.
dlga_start:cdf_camp_siege_final|I have great difficulty believing that you did it... what you just said, avoid mentioning it to others if you don't want them to slice his hand to take the ring.
dlga_cdf_camp_siege_final:close_window|I won't reveal this secret to anyone else than the Duke.
dlga_start:cdf_camp_siege_vic_bague|Where were you, my friend? The guard post is here, you know?
dlga_cdf_camp_siege_vic_bague:cdf_camp_siege_vic_bague2|I was on the other side of the citadel when I spotted an underpass. I took the advantage of surprise and killed de Penthièvre...
dlga_cdf_camp_siege_vic_bague2:cdf_camp_siege_vic_bague3|I took his signet ring from his body, here...
dlga_cdf_camp_siege_vic_bague3:cdf_camp_siege_vic_bague4|What? Bugger... how did you do that?
dlga_cdf_camp_siege_vic_bague4:cdf_camp_siege_vic_bague5|By being bold, Sergeant...
dlga_cdf_camp_siege_vic_bague5:cdf_camp_siege_vic_bague6|You better show that jewelry to the Duke in person, he will hand 25000 crowns for you. Everyone knows that it's what he promised to give to the person that slays the bastard de Penthièvre.
dlga_cdf_camp_siege_vic_bague6:cdf_camp_siege_vic_bague7|How much??? I will request a hearing from the the Duke.
dlga_cdf_camp_siege_vic_bague7:close_window|Guard the ring well, without it the Duke won't give you anything. Although I still find it hard to believe myself.
dlga_start:cdf_camp_siege_renf|Who am I speaking to? Reinforcements?
dlga_cdf_camp_siege_renf:cdf_camp_siege_renf2|The captain sent me to increase the number of our troops. Sergeant, please give me a rundown on what has happened lately?

dlga_village_elder_tell_deliver_grain_mission:village_elder_tell_deliver_grain_mission_2|Hmm, how much grain do you need?
dlga_village_elder_tell_deliver_grain_mission:village_elder_deliver_grain_mission_reject|I can't be bothered with this. Ask help from someone else.
dlga_village_elder_tell_deliver_grain_mission_2:village_elder_tell_deliver_grain_mission_3|I think {reg5} packs of grain will let us start the planting. Hopefully, we can find charitable people to help us with the rest.

dlga_arena_training_melee_intro_reward:arena_training_melee_intro_2|There is, actually. Some of the wealthy townsmen offer prizes for those fighters who show great skill in the fights.

dlga_merchant_finale:close_window|Yes, yes... Now, a couple of my boys have the watch captain pinned down in a back room, with a knife at his throat. I'll need to go drag him before {s5} and explain what this breach of the peace is all about. You don't need to be part of that, though. I'll tell you what -- if all goes well, I'll meet you in the tavern again shortly, and let you know how it all came out. If you don't see me in the tavern, but instead see my head on a spike over the city gate, I'll assume you know enough to stay out of town for a while and forget this whole episode ever happened. So -- hopefully we'll meet again!
dlga_start:merchant_quest_1_prologue_1|{s1}
dlga_merchant_quest_1_prologue_1:merchant_quest_1_prologue_2|We've always had brigands in the hills, driven to banditry by war, debt, or love of violence. Recently, however, they've been getting bolder -- leaving their camps in the wild and venturing into town, looking for unwary prey. The watch commander tells us it's because of all the fighting on the frontiers -- fewer men to keep an eye on the streets -- but I'm not sure what to make of that. It seems to me that the most logical explanation is that these bandits have an ally inside the walls, who helps them enter unnoticed and helps them identify particularly tempting targets... Last week, you see, they took my brother.
dlga_merchant_quest_1_prologue_2:merchant_quest_1_prologue_3|I don't know what my brother was thinking -- a lad from a prominent house, out alone after dark in times like these... Well, I suppose you were too, but you're a stranger here, and didn't know how bad things have become. He had no such excuse. But he's family, so what can you do? If you don't protect your kin, then people will start thinking that you can't protect your investments, either, and I can't have that... No doubt the gang will soon send word about a ransom, but I don't care to pay it.
dlga_merchant_quest_1_prologue_3:merchant_quest_1a|So here's my proposition. You look like you've had a bit of experience with a blade -- and more importantly, you must have a bit of fire in your belly, or you wouldn't be coming to France to seek your fortune. So here's what I'm asking you to do: gather a small party, track down these bandits to their lair, teach them a lesson they won't forget, and get my brother back safe. In return, you'll earn my lasting gratitude and a bit of silver. What do you say?
dlga_merchant_quest_1a:merchant_quest_1b|I am interested.
dlga_merchant_quest_1a:close_window|I am not interested, have more important business to do.
dlga_merchant_quest_1b:merchant_quest_1c|You won't be able to do this by yourself, though. If you try and take on the whole gang single handedly, the hunter will become the hunted, I'll warrant. You'll first want to round up a group of volunteers. There's always a few lads in the villages around here, looking for a bit of work that's more interesting than tilling the soil or hauling water. They'll follow you if you pay. So... Take this purse of 100 crowns. Consider it an advance on your reward. Go round to the villages, and use the money to hire some help. I'll reckon that you need at least five men to take on these bandits.
dlga_merchant_quest_1c:merchant_quest_1d|Very good, sir. I'll go collect some men from around the villages.
dlga_merchant_quest_1d:close_window|Good. You can find me again in the tavern here in {s1} after you've got your group together. Then we'll speak about what we do next.
dlga_start:battle_reason_stated.1|Surrender or die. Make your choice
dlga_battle_reason_stated:close_window|I am not afraid of you. I will fight.
dlga_start:free|Hello. What can I do for you?

dlga_member_give_order_invite_feast_verify_2:member_pretalk|On second thought, this is perhaps not the time.
dlga_member_give_order_invite_feast:member_pretalk|All right then. I shall dispatch messengers informing the lords of the realm of your feast at {s4}.
dlga_member_direct_campaign_call_to_arms_verify:member_give_order_call_to_arms_verify_2|You wish to summon all lords for a new campaign?
dlga_member_give_order_call_to_arms_verify_2:member_give_order_call_to_arms|Yes. We must gather all our forces before we march on the enemy.
dlga_member_give_order_call_to_arms_verify_2:member_pretalk|On second thought, it won't be necessary to summon everyone.
dlga_member_give_order_call_to_arms:member_pretalk|All right then. I will send messengers and tell everyone to come here.
dlga_member_give_order_disband_army_verify:member_give_order_disband_army_2|You want to end the current campaign and release all lords from duty?
dlga_member_give_order_disband_army_2:member_give_order_disband_army|Yes. We no longer need all our forces here.
dlga_member_give_order_disband_army_2:member_pretalk|On second thought, it will be better to stay together for now.
dlga_member_give_order_disband_army:member_pretalk|All right. I will let everyone know that they are released from duty.
