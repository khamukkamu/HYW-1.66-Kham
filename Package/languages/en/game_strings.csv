str_town_alt_prosperity_20|You hear grumbling in the marketplace about the price of everyday items and the shops are half empty.

str_town_alt_prosperity_80|The walls, streets, and homes are well-maintained. The markets are thronged with migrants from the nearby regions drawn here by the availability of both goods and work. The rhythm of hammers and looms speak to the business of the artisans' workshops.
str_village_alt_prosperity_0|Only a handful of people are strong enough to work in the fields, many of which are becoming overgrown with weeds. The rest are weak and malnourished, or have already fled elsewhere. The draft animals have long since starved or were eaten, although a few carcasses still lie on the outskirts, their bones knawed by wild beasts.
str_village_alt_prosperity_20|Some farmers and animals are out in the fields, but their small numbers suggest that some villagers may be emigrating in search of food. Farm implements look rusty and broken. Brush and weeds seem to be reclaiming some of the outermost fields.
str_village_alt_prosperity_40|The fields and orchards are busy, with villagers engaged in the tasks of the seasons. Humans and animals alike look relatively healthy and well-fed.

str_village_alt_prosperity_80|The fields and orchards are humming with activity, with freshly dug irrigation ditches suggest that the farmers have enough spare time and energy to expand area under cultivation. Seasonal laborers appear to be flocking here to help with the work and join in the general prosperity.
str_oasis_village_alt_prosperity_0|The palm groves are virtually abandoned, and the canals which irrigate them are clogged with silt. The handful of villagers you see look malnourished and restless. The draft animals have long since starved or were eaten, although a few carcasses still lie on the outskirts, their bones knawed by the wild jackals of the desert.
str_oasis_village_alt_prosperity_20|Few villagers can be seen tending to the palm groves, and in places, the desert dunes appear to be encroaching on the gardens. Many of the canals are clogged with silt, and the wells and cisterns are filled with sand.
str_oasis_village_alt_prosperity_40|Men and women are busy tending the palm groves, climbing to the tops of trees to pollinate the fruit. Healthy animals draw the pumps and wheels that bring water to the fields. Some of the irrigation canals and cisterns, however, could use some maintenance.
str_oasis_village_alt_prosperity_60|The palm groves and orchards are humming with activity. Farmers call to each other cheerfully from the tops of the trees, where they pollinate the date fruit.

str_oasis_village_alt_prosperity_80|The palm groves are humming with activity, as farmers load up a bumper crop of dates for sale to the market. Men and women are hard at work digging new wells and canals, to bring additional land under irrigation.

str_retirement_text_1|Only too late do you realise that your money won't last. It doesn't take you long to fritter away what little you bothered to save, and you fare poorly in several desperate attempts to start adventuring again. You end up a beggar in {s9}, living on alms and the charity of the church.
str_retirement_text_2|Only too late do you realise that your money won't last. It doesn't take you long to fritter away what little you bothered to save. Once every crown has evaporated in your hands you are forced to start a life of crime in the backstreets of {s9}, using your skills to eke out a living robbing coppers from women and poor townsmen.
str_retirement_text_3|Only too late do you realise that your money won't last. It doesn't take you long to fritter away what little you bothered to save, and you end up a penniless drifter, going from tavern to tavern bumming drinks from indulgent patrons by regaling them with war stories that no one ever believes.
str_retirement_text_4|The silver you've saved doesn't last long, but you manage to put together enough to buy some land near the village of {s7}. There you become a free farmer, and you soon begin to attract potential {wives/husbands}. In time the villagers come to treat you as their local hero. You always receive a place of honour at feasts, and your exploits are told and retold in the pubs and taverns so that the children may keep a memory of you for ever and ever.
str_retirement_text_5|The silver you've saved doesn't last long, but it's enough to buy a small tavern in {s9}. Although the locals are wary of you at first, they soon accept you into their midst. In time your growing tavern becomes a popular feast hall and meeting place. People come for miles to eat or stay there due to your sheer renown and the epic stories you tell of your adventuring days.
str_retirement_text_6|You've saved wisely throughout your career, and now your silver and your intelligence allow you to make some excellent investments to cement your future. After buying several shops and warehouses in {s9}, your shrewdness turns you into one of the most prominent merchants in town, and you soon become a wealthy {man/woman} known as much for your trading empire as your exploits in battle.
str_retirement_text_7|As a landed noble, however minor, your future is all but assured. You settle in your holdfast at {s7}, administrating the village and fields, adjudicating the local courts and fulfilling your obligations to your liege lord. Occasionally your liege calls you to muster and command in his campaigns, but these stints are brief, and you never truly return to the adventuring of your younger days. You have already made your fortune. With your own hall and holdings, you've few wants that your personal wealth and the income of your lands cannot afford you.
str_retirement_text_8|There is no question that you've done very well for yourself. Your extensive holdings and adventuring wealth are enough to guarantee you a rich and easy life for the rest of your days. Retiring to your noble seat in {s8}, you exchange adventure for politics, and you soon establish yourself as a considerable power in your liege lord's kingdom. With intrigue to busy yourself with, your own forests to hunt, a hall to feast in and a hundred fine war stories to tell, you have little trouble making the best of the years that follow.
str_retirement_text_9|As a reward for your competent and loyal service, your liege lord decrees that you be given a hereditary title, joining the major nobility of the realm. Soon you complete your investiture as baron of {s7}, and you become one of your liege's close advisors and adjutants.

str_npc1_intro|Yes, what can I do for you? May you do this right now.
str_npc2_intro|Greetings, do you have sympathy for a humble squire?
str_npc3_intro|Good day, traveler!
str_npc4_intro|Good day {Messire/Madame}, what is your relationship to this war?
str_npc5_intro|Hello {Messire/Madame}, are you a captain of a troop?
str_npc6_intro|Greetings, are you the captain of a group of mercenaries?
str_npc7_intro|To your health, traveler, let the Hunt be good.
str_npc8_intro|What do you want?
str_npc9_intro|Yes? What can I do for you?
str_npc10_intro|Greetings fellow traveler, would you like to have a drink with me?
str_npc11_intro|Hello {sire/young lady}, have a beer with me.
str_npc12_intro|You seem to have a very bad injury, traveller. I am a doctor, and it looks to me that it can get infected.
str_npc13_intro|What are you looking at, did you lose something?
str_npc14_intro|Hey, look who's here. What's new, friend? By the way, have you gone... you know or...?
str_npc15_intro|Greetings, are not you by chance the leader of this mercenary company I saw entering the city?
str_npc16_intro|{Sire/Madame}, if I may... Are you far from your {wife/husband}? Do you need my help?
str_npc1_intro_response_1|What does a nobleman do in a tavern? Moreover, you do not seem to be at ease.
str_npc2_intro_response_1|Have you lost your way? What happened to you, squire?
str_npc3_intro_response_1|Hello, are you a mercenary?
str_npc4_intro_response_1|I would like to know your own first.
str_npc5_intro_response_1|Perhaps. Why?
str_npc6_intro_response_1|Indeed, are you interested?
str_npc7_intro_response_1|What Hunt are you talking about?
str_npc8_intro_response_1|Just talk, if you don't mind.
str_npc9_intro_response_1|Too nice a uniform to wear in a tavern.
str_npc10_intro_response_1|Why not, in honour of what?
str_npc11_intro_response_1|In honour of what?
str_npc12_intro_response_1|Thank you, what should I do?
str_npc13_intro_response_1|Relax, friend, I'm looking to recruit mercenaries that's all. Let me buy you a drink?
str_npc14_intro_response_1|Yes I have been, your cause interests me.
str_npc15_intro_response_1|Indeed, why do you ask?
str_npc16_intro_response_1|You speak well for a convoy runner, or are you educated?
str_npc1_intro_response_2|Talking to you was engaging, but I'm in a hurry. Farewell.
str_npc2_intro_response_2|I have better things to do than get drunk in a brothel.
str_npc3_intro_response_2|I do not have the time to discuss this.
str_npc4_intro_response_2|That's a very indiscreet question, farewell.
str_npc5_intro_response_2|Go your own way.
str_npc6_intro_response_2|It is none of your business, sir.
str_npc7_intro_response_2|No time to drink. Farewell.
str_npc8_intro_response_2|From you? Absolutely nothing, farewell.
str_npc9_intro_response_2|I thought I recognized someone. Farewell.
str_npc10_intro_response_2|There are other things to do than waste time in a tavern. Goodbye.
str_npc11_intro_response_2|No thank you. Goodbye.
str_npc12_intro_response_2|We all end up dead anyways. Farewell.
str_npc13_intro_response_2|Find someone else to fight you, drunkard.
str_npc14_intro_response_2|No I have not, nor does war elsewhere interest me.
str_npc15_intro_response_2|It's none of your business, farewell.
str_npc16_intro_response_2|No, I do not need a whore.
str_npc1_backstory_a|I see, my name is Perceval of Blois, I am a former guard captain and I am at the tavern to recruit men in order to set up a small company of mercenaries.
str_npc2_backstory_a|This is a tragic tale, but I'm happy that someone wants to hear it.
str_npc3_backstory_a|Mercenary? No, much better than that, I'm a sergeant-at-arms, at least I was, I just got relieved from duty.
str_npc4_backstory_a|Well {sire/madame}, for me it is a disaster. I lost everything because of this war. I had a beautiful farm in which I was producing quality milk and good butter, I was also in poultry. Moreover, the land was so good that it allowed me to grow grains of excellent quality. But my pride and joy were my horses, the best in the area, from a beautiful lineage.
str_npc5_backstory_a|That's what it seemed to me. Looking at you, I would say that you are both enterprising and ambitious.
str_npc6_backstory_a|I happen to be a mercenary and I am looking for a company. I know how to wield the sword well and I am quite fast.
str_npc7_backstory_a|I am a hunter, and although it has led me to a dungeon by having hunted in the lands of the nobles, I will not cease this activity. Do you know a forest that does not belong to a noble? It is a shame, as if it were the nobles who had made the trees grow.
str_npc8_backstory_a|I advise you not to mess with me or you will not have time to regret. I've been a hangman for a long time, and ironically, an outlaw. All that to warn you that lopping of heads comes easy to me.
str_npc9_backstory_a|Although I have not completed my classes, I am gone to war, my {lord/lady}.
str_npc10_backstory_a|I am currently looking for employment. Have a drink and I'll tell you everything there is to know.
str_npc11_backstory_a|Do you need an excuse to drink? The trip was long and I'm thirsty, that's all.
str_npc12_backstory_a|I am a traveling doctor and a good Christian, in these incessant times of war I am working to save as much life as I can.
str_npc13_backstory_a|How can I refuse? So you're looking for men who know how to fight?
str_npc14_backstory_a|Great friend, know that we are always looking for dedicated fighters. There are still a handful of empty bellies, but soon, we will have an army.
str_npc15_backstory_a|I am an engineer, I study siege engines, and I am desperately looking for an employer. Have you ever seen a bombard shoot up close? I bet not.
str_npc16_backstory_a|You see, my {lord/lady}, I have never been in need since I was young, I know how to wield my tongue as a weapon in many cases.
str_npc1_backstory_b|Or even join a company already formed so naturally I hold a key position.
str_npc2_backstory_b|I was Lord Graham's squire. Some call my former master the Little Master of Fortune. He carried the arms in the name of King Edward until the day he met one of our King's sons in a tournament in London. His Majesty Prince Lionel has jousted against Lord Graham, but there was a terrible accident. When the prince fell, my Lord's horse tripped, and sent my lord directly to the prince's spear, killing him instantly.
str_npc3_backstory_b|An unfortunate affair, believe me, I was assigned to the guard of a royal house while he was killed by a crossbow's bolt before my eyes. The shooting came from the thickets while the prince was coming out of the coach. Unfortunately, being the only non-noble person present, I was immediately charged. No matter, they do not know what they are losing.
str_npc4_backstory_b|For my family and me it was a huge work, but we managed to live well, despite the exorbitant taxes. We lived happily ever after with my wife and two teenage children, until this horrible night when everything turned upside down. I'm reliving the scene every moment.
str_npc5_backstory_b|I am Hermance, I am a former soldier turned merchant. Without bragging, I think I have mastered the art of making a profit. I had a stall not so long ago in Bordeaux, my city, but I was removed from it by an English noble. I must tell you at once that I do not have the English in my heart.
str_npc6_backstory_b|You have to wonder why I do not have a company yet, however it turns out that I had one or more that I used to be part of, but now am the only survivor.
str_npc7_backstory_b|However I have more than enough of jails. I look for work as a guide or tracker. The nobles do not want to hire me to hunt with them, but I do not like how they hunt anyways. I know how to handle a bow and track game, I can even follow a small group at a distance.
str_npc8_backstory_b|I must say that I take some pleasure in killing men, one can say that I am an assassin, and for a price, I can kill anyone.
str_npc9_backstory_b|Forgive me we do not know each other, and I'm afraid I do not have too many friends to say this, but I was attached to the host of the Dauphin of France in order to flee for my life. You see, a damsel which I was madly attached broke our future.
str_npc10_backstory_b|I am a master of arms. I have traveled all over France. I have always done a good job. And then I served the Lord of Nevers, who had such contempt for me. His son came to train, and during his first tournament, the lazy pug had his arm broken. It was not my fault, but his father took advantage of the child's misfortune to dismiss me.
str_npc11_backstory_b|I am a blacksmith and I come from Dijon, although the Burgundians are regarded well everywhere in France, I do not deny my origins. Moreover, I am a merchant of arms.
str_npc12_backstory_b|I have already traveled a large area of France, and I no longer count the men whom God has saved by my hand, and how many nights have I spent battle after battle, sewing limbs and dressing wounds.
str_npc13_backstory_b|Ah, that beer is good. I'm kind of a mercenary, although I'm the bastard of a noble whose name I forgot, I always had to manage by myself when I grew up in the garbage of Bourges.
str_npc14_backstory_b|These English bastards, but these Burgandy traitors are not any better. Their miserable Duke will never cease wanting to enslave us. Our goal is to hinder and to delay them in their objectives in order to discourage them. Do you understand? We should not speak too loud...
str_npc15_backstory_b|Until the other day, I was the personal tutor of the son of the lord of {s20}. But this stingy man was starting to find that my personal salary was far too high. He fired me, so I'm looking for another employer.
str_npc16_backstory_b|My mother was a servant in a castle. The Lord had given her three bastards and I was the last, before he let us all die of hunger. I seduced the lord and I forced him to get married with me.  Of course he died after that, and the castle was ours, what a sad day, my {lord/lady}, if you could have seen how sad I was...
str_npc1_backstory_c|I am an excellent rider and I know how to use a lance, I have even won a tournament at one point.
str_npc2_backstory_c|After his death, I swore to kill a hundred of his enemies in his name, so I am looking for employment as a squire to achieve it.
str_npc3_backstory_c|I would like, at first, to join a mercenary company and thus live from my job as a skilled man-at-arms. You may be able to help me.
str_npc4_backstory_c|A strong smell of burning, outside the flames rose so high and soldiers were screaming so loudly, running, hiding. I realized that I was alone, invaded by atrocious fears about the fate of my family. And then the silence, the early morning, my beautiful charred farm, oh my god my wife, my children, dead. So I'm looking for a company where I could enlist to fight the injustice of the war, and thus avenge mine.
str_npc5_backstory_c|I have since been looking for employment or I would not be paid as a blacksmith apprentice. I remember my martial foundation and moreover, I am a good trader and would be useful for your company, what do you say?
str_npc6_backstory_c|We were incorporated into the troops of the Dauphin of France, the day of the last battle with my comrades, we were faced with an English company. Inferior in number, we were cut to shreds. Since that day, I wish to continue my trade by becoming a mercenary and avenge my comrades by cutting down English scum. No worries, even if my thirst is hard to quench, I am not suicidal and would not fail my orders on a battlefield.
str_npc7_backstory_c|For you, I can be a hunter, and man is the game that I also know how to hunt. Are you interested?
str_npc8_backstory_c|I try to pick up as much loot as possible before I retire, maybe someday, I will open a brothel. If I survive, I intend to have the money to have a good life.
str_npc9_backstory_c|I am the son of the lord Charles de Bourbon, and my naivety has prevented me from perceiving that the marriage with Dame Eleonore de Poitou was only an arrangement between our families. Do you understand? She never had the slightest feeling for me. It is a tragedy, I leave for the French host and for a destination less glorious than that for which I was prepared, as long as I am not under the orders of my father. I would even follow a troupe of bandits or mercenaries if someone entered this tavern and offered it to me. If my lord has claimed my tears, let him take my blood and my life, so be it.
str_npc10_backstory_c|After, I traveled from town to town looking for employment as a trainer, without result. I would be very grateful if a mercenary captain was willing to enlist me in his company.
str_npc11_backstory_c|In spite of everything, I know how to use a sword, and to tell you everything, I'm looking for the brigands who looted and burnt my forge, even if I must kill them all. Do you realize the scourge that these groups of looters cause on the roads? I am trying to form a militia to fight them and to repeat to them a hundred times what they took from me. Would you be interested?
str_npc12_backstory_c|In spite of my unshakable faith, I often hate what the nobles are doing to their men-at-arms, does not the shepherd have love and protection for his sheep? How diabolical is it to use men and women for political ends?
str_npc13_backstory_c|I've been stealing to survive, but I've spent my life fighting for food, and over the years I've been fighting for more and more money and against more and more experienced troops, if you you want a solid infantryman whom you can trust to ensure your rear, you have it in front of you.
str_npc14_backstory_c|If you allow me to join you, my crossbow will serve you, and in return I could ask you to help mine, what do you say? It seems to me a good deal.
str_npc15_backstory_c|I would be extremely grateful if someone could provide me employment in my field.
str_npc16_backstory_c|Unfortunately, these gentlemen are more and more suspicious and it becomes almost impossible to make a living. Do you  need my services by chance?
str_npc1_backstory_later|I traveled from taverns to taverns to set up a mercenary company, but I only had drunkards who could barely stand up.
str_npc2_backstory_later|I traveled from field to field, but my engagements were not very chivalrous.
str_npc3_backstory_later|I have traveled, but people seem terribly ignorant. Some even insult me by calling me worthless. If only I could find a company worthy of the name.
str_npc4_backstory_later|I went back to my charred earth, but I encountered too many insurmountable difficulties. Alone, without tools, without money, impossible to embark on a reconstruction. I asked for help, but no one answered my call. So here I am, and I'm looking for employment.
str_npc5_backstory_later|I still have not found a stable work, I desperately seek a true companion of road, {sire/madame}.
str_npc6_backstory_later|Since then I have wandered here, looking for a good company with real fighters, but I have seen nothing good, only the arrogant and the pretentious, whose acts were only feigned and cowardly.
str_npc7_backstory_later|I traveled and looked for employment as a tracker. But I only met ignorant and lousy poachers.
str_npc8_backstory_later|I traveled in search of loot and troops to kill, but here there are only peasants to pluck, those that do not even know how to defend themselves. I think I prefer to come with you, my brutal strength could be you useful.
str_npc9_backstory_later|I have toured Europe, offering the services of a warrior, but they are too stingy to maintain a knight. It seems that I am condemned to wander, looking for something better.
str_npc10_backstory_later|I engaged in the service of some French lords, but it never lasted very long. If only I could find someone who would enjoy old-fashioned discipline.
str_npc11_backstory_later|I searched all over the region groups of looters, hoping to find those who destroyed my forge. I joined bounty hunters and we had a lot of blood on our hands. Despite all, my thirst for vengeance is not yet sated. I then found a very profitable business reselling what they had stolen.
str_npc12_backstory_later|I traveled from town to village, I saved as many servants of God as I could, but it goes without saying that it was with you that I had the most work and opportunities for exercise my art, even if sometimes you scare me.
str_npc13_backstory_later|Ha, my friend, I've travelled all the taverns, and none of them serves anything but the Burgandian piss, I'm tired of it, I prefer to go on the road with you.
str_npc14_backstory_later|I wandered from different camps, with a hungry stomach and without having the slightest opportunity to take action against the enemy, I think it's still with you that I'm most likely to serve my cause.
str_npc15_backstory_later|I traveled around the area looking for a good employer, but I was just hired as a mason. Is there no one that prefers a siege engineer to a mason?
str_npc16_backstory_later|I've been through little quests lately, but nothing really profitable.
str_npc1_backstory_response_1|You could join us.
str_npc2_backstory_response_1|You could join us.
str_npc3_backstory_response_1|You could join us.
str_npc4_backstory_response_1|Employment is possible in my company.
str_npc5_backstory_response_1|Employment is possible in my company.
str_npc6_backstory_response_1|A good mercenary would be very useful to me.
str_npc7_backstory_response_1|I can make a place for you in my company.
str_npc8_backstory_response_1|I ... you seem as strong as you are dangerous, but I guess you'll be an asset on a battlefield, why don't you join my group?
str_npc9_backstory_response_1|Well, it's a coincidence, I happen to be trying to form a troupe of mercenaries, and having a noble-blooded squire in our ranks would be a blessing.
str_npc10_backstory_response_1|If you are looking for work, I need fighters.
str_npc11_backstory_response_1|I propose you to join my own troop of fighters, what do you say?
str_npc12_backstory_response_1|Would you agree to look after my men and myself?
str_npc13_backstory_response_1|One more blade would not be too much in our ranks.
str_npc14_backstory_response_1|I can offer you the opportunity to join me.
str_npc15_backstory_response_1|You could be useful to my group.
str_npc16_backstory_response_1|You intrigue me, could you for example seduce an enemy lord and make him drink poison, is this the kind of things you can do?
str_npc1_backstory_response_2|Forgive me, but I can not do anything for you.
str_npc2_backstory_response_2|Forgive me, but I can not do anything for you.
str_npc3_backstory_response_2|Forgive me, but I can not do anything for you.
str_npc4_backstory_response_2|Forgive me, but I can not do anything for you.
str_npc5_backstory_response_2|Forgive me, but I can not do anything for you.
str_npc6_backstory_response_2|Forgive me, but I can not do anything for you.
str_npc7_backstory_response_2|Forgive me, but I can not do anything for you.
str_npc8_backstory_response_2|Forgive me, but I can not do anything for you.
str_npc9_backstory_response_2|Come on, you'll get back on top after a good binge.
str_npc10_backstory_response_2|Forgive me, but I can not do anything for you.
str_npc11_backstory_response_2|Forgive me, but I can not do anything for you.
str_npc12_backstory_response_2|Forgive me, but I can not do anything for you.
str_npc13_backstory_response_2|Forgive me, but I can not do anything for you.
str_npc14_backstory_response_2|Get off me, beggar. I do not offer charity.
str_npc15_backstory_response_2|Forgive me, but I can not do anything for you.
str_npc16_backstory_response_2|No thanks, no scheming in my company, goodbye.
str_npc1_signup|Good, I can join you for a while, I'll tell you later.
str_npc2_signup|I would be very honored to fight by your side.
str_npc3_signup|It will be a pleasure to join you.
str_npc4_signup|You know, I am sturdy, tireless, resistant to the hardest tasks. And it is not because I am a peasant that I do not have the sense of command and a certain intelligence.
str_npc5_signup|I would be indebted to you, {sire/madame}. My experience is good enough that I can bring you something, as long as your cause is right.
str_npc6_signup|You will not be disappointed, you know, I would have liked to continue fighting the English but I was knocked out. I could have done something and killed some more and saved at least one comrade.
str_npc7_signup|How could I refuse? The danger does not scare me.
str_npc8_signup|A mercenary company? That is fine, provided that we collect enough loot and that I am often offered the opportunity to fight.
str_npc9_signup|It's very good, I do not believe in coincidences. I think we are in the right place at the right timem as our Lord wills it. And if my place is to give my life to save another I accept it, such is my Oath of Chivalry that I would not be with the Dauphin, but here in this humble tavern. This oath is only purer than if the dauphin himself had given me an accolade as an anonymous knight.
str_npc10_signup|It will be a pleasure to join you.
str_npc11_signup|Well, it's the same thing, except that it's up to you to pay me right?
str_npc12_signup|Of course, if you happen to be hurt I can get you back on your feet.
str_npc13_signup|It's understood, I'm following you ....
str_npc14_signup|I'm in!
str_npc15_signup|It will be a pleasure to join you.
str_npc16_signup|You're right, I can stick a dagger in your enemy, if you need me to. To me, gold is my passion, and it is found most often on the noble pigs who are seen within brothels.
str_npc1_signup_2|I will follow you.
str_npc2_signup_2|I have a sharp mind, I am at your service.
str_npc3_signup_2|I think you will see that I am a major asset within the group.
str_npc4_signup_2|It is more than thanks to my horses that I learned to ride, I am an excellent rider. And if you give me the means, your enemies will learn to fear me. I have such a strong rage in me that I will not give them a chance to escape. I will sow terror and torment in their ranks.
str_npc5_signup_2|As long as you do not fail in your duty by giving me food, paying me and avoiding sending me a battle that is a lost cause, I am at your service. But I warn you, I will not do anything inconsistent with my beliefs.
str_npc6_signup_2|Captain, let me use my talents by your side. I have no fear of dying, if I have to face your enemies without armor, and even nude. As long as I drank all my booze, you'll see that's how I'm the best at the battle.
str_npc7_signup_2|I will finally be able to live without fearing the guard and the jails, you will not regret it I can find a group of fugitives who tries to hide his tracks, I think you would find me useful, and I win my keep especially when I do not need to hunt for my dinner as an outlaw.
str_npc8_signup_2|I agree.
str_npc9_signup_2|I see no shame in having to obey the orders of an experienced captain even if he is not of noble blood. On the contrary, may you have the determination of soul and you'll the strength of one hundred lions.
str_npc10_signup_2|You won't regret your choice.
str_npc11_signup_2|I do not care in what manner we go about it, as long as we take care of all these looters and bandits along the way, I will follow you.
str_npc12_signup_2|You can count on me, but I warn you, I will not tolerate indecent behavior in your company.
str_npc13_signup_2|We will accomplish feats.
str_npc14_signup_2|I get stronger everyday through rigorous training. I burn with the desire to get rid of these pigs, and the atrocities in this war only make me stronger and comfort me in my convictions.
str_npc15_signup_2|I will always be there when the need arises.
str_npc16_signup_2|And as you know I can convince a man to do what I want, I could sow the ideas that you desire in the minds of your enemies, and even sleep with them for a while, to prove to you my power of persuasion.
str_npc1_signup_response_1|I am sure you can be useful to our cause, noble knight.
str_npc2_signup_response_1|That would be excellent and we would be happy to take you along.
str_npc3_signup_response_1|Um, that will do the trick.
str_npc4_signup_response_1|Very well. I'll be glad to have you with us.
str_npc5_signup_response_1|Well, then you'll be useful to us.
str_npc6_signup_response_1|Gather your things, we'll get started.
str_npc7_signup_response_1|I will hire you, a tracker and a hunter will be of use to me.
str_npc8_signup_response_1|This will do the trick, but try not to make fuss.
str_npc9_signup_response_1|I'll hire you, but do not quote too many passages during the voyage, if you please young lord, the life of a warrior is not that sophisticated.
str_npc10_signup_response_1|You will be useful to us.
str_npc11_signup_response_1|It sounds like you'll be useful. You are hired.
str_npc12_signup_response_1|I welcome you among us.
str_npc13_signup_response_1|Good enough. Pack your things and be ready to move out.
str_npc14_signup_response_1|Good. You sound like just what we need.
str_npc15_signup_response_1|It is with pleasure that I hire you.
str_npc16_signup_response_1|Very tempting. I'll hire you.
str_npc1_signup_response_2|Forgive me, I do not wish to hire you.
str_npc2_signup_response_2|Forgive me, I do not wish to hire you.
str_npc3_signup_response_2|Actually, I do not want to hire you.
str_npc4_signup_response_2|Unfortunately, I have no room for you.
str_npc5_signup_response_2|Forgive me, I do not wish to hire you.
str_npc6_signup_response_2|I do not need a drunkard, look elsewhere.
str_npc7_signup_response_2|You will only be a source of trouble, goodbye.
str_npc8_signup_response_2|All in all, I do not want to hire you.
str_npc9_signup_response_2|Do not begrudge me, but I do not wish to hire you.
str_npc10_signup_response_2|All in all, I do not want to hire you.
str_npc11_signup_response_2|Forgive me, but we have enough men for the moment.
str_npc12_signup_response_2|On second thought, I do not want to hire you.
str_npc13_signup_response_2|On second thought, I do not want to hire you.
str_npc14_signup_response_2|On second thought, I do not want to hire you.
str_npc15_signup_response_2|To be honest, I do not want to hire you.
str_npc16_signup_response_2|Pretty girl, you walk in front of your company and troubadours will soon come to town? Get out of here.
str_npc1_payment|I am coming with you but I would first like an advance of {reg3} crowns for down payment to my pay.
str_npc2_payment|I'm coming with you but I would need {reg3} crowns first.
str_npc3_payment|.
str_npc4_payment|Thank you, but before leaving, would you have the extreme kindness to lend me {reg3} crowns? I would like to recover some items at {s20} that I had to give up to survive while waiting for employment.
str_npc5_payment|I'm coming with you, but if you can, I'd like to start with an advance of {reg3} crowns so that I can pay off my debts.
str_npc6_payment|.
str_npc7_payment|I'm leaving with you, but I need {reg3} crowns first. You understand, I have to pay the innkeeper or I will be thrown in jail.
str_npc8_payment|I'm coming with you, but first I'd like a bonus of {reg3} crowns to pay off the innkeeper who, during my last glorious battle in his tavern, brought the guard, and then the other guys got away. I had promise I will pay the damage within the week.
str_npc9_payment|Understood Captain, but I must first ask you for a bonus of {reg3} crowns to get a horse, otherwise I would be little use as a knight.
str_npc10_payment|Very kind to you, I am coming with you but I would like an advance of {reg3} crowns first.
str_npc11_payment|Very good {messire/my lady}, and in this respect I estimate my first pay at {reg3} crowns. I know that some soldiers can serve weeks without being paid, but I'm not the type to be fooled.
str_npc12_payment|.
str_npc13_payment|Before committing myself, I must settle the debt that I contracted here, it will not be said that the great Mathieu de Bourges leaves without clearing his slate, and well ... it is {reg3} crowns in all .
str_npc14_payment|Before leaving I would first like to leave here with a full belly and a lot of wine.
str_npc15_payment|Very kind to you, I am coming with you but I would like an advance of {reg3} crowns first.
str_npc16_payment|This is good news, my lord. How about sealing our deal with a small payment? {reg3} crowns is a reasonable sum for a start.
str_npc1_payment_response|Very well, here's {reg3} crowns. Now, fall in with the rest.
str_npc2_payment_response|Of course, here's {reg3} crowns for your expenses.
str_npc3_payment_response|.
str_npc4_payment_response|Certainly. Here's {reg3} crowns.
str_npc5_payment_response|Well... here's {reg3} crowns, then. Your first payment.
str_npc6_payment_response|.
str_npc7_payment_response|Here's your {reg3} crowns, hunter.
str_npc8_payment_response|Here are your {reg3} crowns, and more glorious battles in taverns but against real enemies, that's for sure.
str_npc9_payment_response|That shouldn't be a problem, here's {reg3} crowns.
str_npc10_payment_response|Of course. Here, {reg3} crowns.
str_npc11_payment_response|Very well, here's {reg3} crowns. Make yourself ready. We leave soon.
str_npc12_payment_response|.
str_npc13_payment_response|Of course, here's {reg3} crowns. Make ready to leave soon.
str_npc14_payment_response|All right, here's {reg3} crowns. You are most welcome in our company.
str_npc15_payment_response|All right, here's {reg3} crowns. Glad to have you with us.
str_npc16_payment_response|All right, here's {reg3} crowns for you. Make yourself ready.
str_npc1_morality_speech|Oy -- boss. Please don't take this the wrong way, but it's a hard life and it's a bit much that we {s21}. Take a little more care in the future, captain, if you don't mind my saying.
str_npc2_morality_speech|I hope you don't mind my saying so, but I am rather dismayed to see us {s21}. Perhaps I ought to be more open to such things for such is the way of war, but if we could show some mercy to our foes as is chivalrous, I'd sleep better.
str_npc3_morality_speech|I do not know if I should say this, {sir/madame}, but I admit that I am somewhat surprised that we {s21}. I knew war was cruel, but not like this. The bards and minstrels should have a word with me for the truths of this 'chivalrous' war.
str_npc4_morality_speech|Forgive me, but know that I do not appreciate this, {s21}. I am not very comfortable with the idea going that route.
str_npc5_morality_speech|Pardon me, captain. It is not good to {s21}. Your first duty is to the men in your command. The least they can expect is food, pay, the opportunity to loot, and that you not waste their lives needlessly.
str_npc6_morality_speech|Excuse me captain, but I did not expect this, {s21}.
str_npc7_morality_speech|Captain -- I do not like to see us {s21}. Such are the actions of a common bandit leader, with no regard for his followers.
str_npc8_morality_speech|Eh! I do not appreciate this, {s21}
str_npc9_morality_speech|Captain, that does not suit me, {s21}. I would be grateful if you would not overwhelm me in the future with a decision as stupid as the one I took in following you, know that I still believe in you despite this, I just wanted to tell you.
str_npc10_morality_speech|My apologies captain, I can not say that I like it, {s21}.
str_npc11_morality_speech|Excuse me, captain. It's not good that we {s21}. I've followed armies and warbands for 30 years, and the least the soldiers expect of a leader is to feed them, pay them, and do {his/her} best to keep their sorry skins intact as best {he/she} can.
str_npc12_morality_speech|{Sire/My Lady}, I do not like that, {s21}. I hope you will consider it in the future.
str_npc13_morality_speech|Captain, if we can avoid it, I'd prefer not to {s21}. I do not want to see our reputation destroyed.
str_npc14_morality_speech|Not to beat around the bush, I did not like it at all, {s21}.
str_npc15_morality_speech|{Sir/Madame} -- just so you know my opinion, any commander with sense will not let his company {s21}.I hope you don't mind me speaking so bluntly.
str_npc16_morality_speech|Captain, I don't like it, {S21}. So many scholarships that will not be searched, and the price of the toilets are so exorbitant in France.
str_npc1_2ary_morality_speech|{Messire/Madame}, I do not mind, {s21} To live and fight another day seems to me more than sensible.
str_npc2_2ary_morality_speech|{Sir/Madame}, that does not satisfy me, {s21}. I do not want a bad reputation.
str_npc3_2ary_morality_speech|{Sir/Madame}, I think your decision was good, {s21}
str_npc4_2ary_morality_speech|Please {Sir/Madame}, what does it matter what others say on this subject, {s21}. It is essential to adopt in these times of trouble, the trick to allow us to resist and triumph when the time comes.
str_npc5_2ary_morality_speech|[No secondary moral code]
str_npc6_2ary_morality_speech|Captain, you can do this, {s21}, but I'd rather not be involved in this case.
str_npc7_2ary_morality_speech|[No secondary moral code]
str_npc8_2ary_morality_speech|[No secondary moral code]
str_npc9_2ary_morality_speech|{Sir/Madame}, this causes me distress, {s21}. A captain of your rank should show a greater sense of honor at all times.
str_npc10_2ary_morality_speech|Captain, I can not say I really appreciate that, {s21}. You should treat your men well, they will repay you with interest.
str_npc11_2ary_morality_speech|[No secondary moral code]
str_npc12_2ary_morality_speech|[No secondary moral code]
str_npc13_2ary_morality_speech|[No secondary moral code]
str_npc14_2ary_morality_speech|Captain -- you should not let it bother you that you {s21}. Armies are made to do their leaders' bidding, and hardships are part of an earnest mercenary's career.
str_npc15_2ary_morality_speech|You know, friend {playername}, it's none too reassuring to see how you just {s21}. If you can break your word to them, you can break your word to me, is how I figure it.
str_npc16_2ary_morality_speech|Captain -- just so you know, it's no problem by me that we {s21}. We do what we need to do to live, and they'd do the same to us if they were in our shoes.
str_npc1_personalityclash_speech|{Sire/Madame}, don't take offense, but {s11} tires me. {s11}'s' behaviour is most uncourteous.
str_npc2_personalityclash_speech|{Sire/Madame}, as you can see, I respect all life. The use of violence without reason is unbearable.
str_npc3_personalityclash_speech|Captain, in my opinion, {s11} is a strange man, he behaves like he's possessed by the demon.
str_npc4_personalityclash_speech|{Sire/Madame}, my family was most respected in my country. In spite of everything, {s11} openly disrespects me and sows the doubt on the values which I defend.
str_npc5_personalityclash_speech|Captain, can you give me a moment? {s11} tires me, his behaviour is not honorable, and he does not hesitate to throw me unsavoury glances, simply because I have already happened to talk to him about respect for others and to mind his behaviour while looting.
str_npc6_personalityclash_speech|Please excuse me, captain, but I cannot remain silent any longer. It's that moron {s11}, that is why I am to stay sober before the battles. I told him that I accept if he left his bow and his sword at the camp, every man knows what is and what is not good for him, it is not his role to judge others.
str_npc7_personalityclash_speech|Chief, I'm doing my best to withstand the disgusting habits of my companions, but {s11} is unbearable.
str_npc8_personalityclash_speech|I want you to know that I can no longer care for {s11}.
str_npc9_personalityclash_speech|{Sire/Madame}, {s11} is a wretch who has no respect for others. I am tired of suffering his behavior.
str_npc10_personalityclash_speech|Excuse me captain, I do not like to disturb you with these things, but I wanted to let you know that I could not stand this Hermance anymore.
str_npc11_personalityclash_speech|I beg your pardon, Captain, but I can not remain silent. This man, {s11}, is a real savage, devoid of the simplest civility.
str_npc12_personalityclash_speech|{Sire/Madame}, {s11} behaves with perversion, there are words I cannot say, and acts I cannot condone, moreover I fear that his evil is not curable, do you understand what I'm saying? It would be necessary place him in an appropriate establishment, not in a company of armed men.
str_npc13_personalityclash_speech|Captain, {s11} exhausts me, I have to tell you.
str_npc14_personalityclash_speech|Friend, I expressed my opinion on the revolution, I speak too much to the camp certainly, but we must ceaselessly forge the ideas of the people, so that he continues to be the defensive spear against the invader.
str_npc15_personalityclash_speech|Excuse me, I hope it does not bother you that I give you my opinion, but this girl, {s11}, puts the group in danger. She is a little savage, disrespectful of the authority and fundamental principles of the army.
str_npc16_personalityclash_speech|Hey captain, you must know, {s11} behaves in a manner beyond belief, he presents me with a purse saying that he would like me to share his bed, tell him that I am not a simple convoy runner. if I happen to sleep with men, it is because they are my targets and I earn much more than a simple pass, I thought this person was intelligent, but he's a real lout.
str_npc1_personalityclash_speech_b|There are some people of low nobility like me, and others are mainly from rural areas, but all of them must respect soldiers.
str_npc2_personalityclash_speech_b|{s11} has no respect.
str_npc3_personalityclash_speech_b|It bothers me to tell you about this, but it's enough, he shows his genitals to us, and then, strangely looks at horses, should I say more?
str_npc4_personalityclash_speech_b|It is true that I feel an unwavering hatred against the unjustified consequences of the war. But I can not allow anyone to denigrate my family, let alone indulgent words about what a peasant woman would do to satisfy her man. If this continues, it could be that the consequences are unfortunate.
str_npc5_personalityclash_speech_b|He have no right to doubt me. I suggested him to leave us if the life of an honourable warrior seems to displease him. I hope you do not mind such a remark.
str_npc6_personalityclash_speech_b|I am well aware that it was a big weakness to pretend to be dead during the fight that cost the lives of my comrades when I was in my last company, but do I have to die so as not to have to live with that? And is it my fault if I have been rageful since?
str_npc7_personalityclash_speech_b|These are the manners of petty bourgeois, who never ceases to call me savage.
str_npc8_personalityclash_speech_b|{s11} makes me angry, and I told you to warn your men against this, that nobody angers me, or I will cut them in half from the top of the skull to their groin.
str_npc9_personalityclash_speech_b|If this continues, I will end up telling him harshly what I think. And if we are to come to blows, we will not have to rely on me for an apology.
str_npc10_personalityclash_speech_b|It's nothing but a brigand who pretends to be a merchant, he tried to sell me my ration do you realize? I am a Weapon Master, and I am not an idiot who begins to try to sell me something that comes back to me and I would remind him that I am a Master.
str_npc11_personalityclash_speech_b|He did not have to retire alone to the camp for long hours, I asked him what he was doing and he told me to fuck off. I'm counting on you to tell him to be a little more respectful.
str_npc12_personalityclash_speech_b|{Sire/Madame}, imagine my dread to hear him put Beelzebub in his sentences while he urinates, and this is just one example, there is much worse, I rely on you to make your arrangements in a Christian way, as per example to abandon it on the way ... good evening {Sire/Madame}.
str_npc13_personalityclash_speech_b|Acts of bravery are laudable but there are other purposes that are quite valid. Personally, I never trust someone who only thinks of fighting.
str_npc14_personalityclash_speech_b|{s11} allowed insolent words to come out of his mouth. I will tell them, to him and to others, the next time he reduced to nothing all my efforts we will come to arms, I wanted you to know it .
str_npc15_personalityclash_speech_b|What's more, I suspect she's a thief. I saw her rummaging in my luggage, she fiddled with my schematics. Then, when I saw fit to intervene, she waved a knife in my direction. A wise captain would not allow her to stay in the group.
str_npc16_personalityclash_speech_b|But I warn you, if he tries even to touch me, I will kick him between his legs, and I swear he will struggle to get up. And if he tries to rape me I cut his throat. You are warned.
str_npc1_personalityclash2_speech|{Sire/Madame}, I'm tired of {s11} this low-ranking person attracts many problems, objects disappear and some fellowships go a little too far, I wanted you to know.
str_npc2_personalityclash2_speech|{Sire/Madame}, if that does not bother you, I'd rather not take part in the same fights than {s11}, after what he told me in the last battle.
str_npc3_personalityclash2_speech|{Messire/Madame}, Since I joined your group, I have tried to get used to your way of commanding and honoring the military code. If I happen to make a mistake from time to time, I hope you will not hold it against me.
str_npc4_personalityclash2_speech|{Messire/Madame}, I had the opportunity to exchange some words with {s11}, it was during the sharing of the spoils of the battle. Please inform her that when she speaks to me, she should be kind enough to respect me by not treating me disdainfully as a peasant.
str_npc5_personalityclash2_speech|Captain, I do not think I'm a sensitive soul, but I do not particularly like the way {s11} expresses himself, you have to hold his tongue.
str_npc6_personalityclash2_speech|Captain, did you notice {s11} during our last battle? It provoked the enemies fallen to the ground during the fight by making fun of their origins and their stupidity to measure against us.
str_npc7_personalityclash2_speech|{Gentleman/Noblelady}, I tried to make {s11} understand that he has to stop harassing me. Let him know that even if I have not done my military classes I do not need his advice. Tell him that if I want to fight like an old lady, I can learn it myself, my method of combat is the bow and the spear, not noble weapons, but effective weapons.
str_npc8_personalityclash2_speech|Hey boss! {s11} is about to reach my breaking pount, how many times will I have to repeat myself? Do not  anger me or there will be blood throughout your camp.
str_npc9_personalityclash2_speech|{Messire/Madame}, I hope you will not mind, but I think {s11} should be put back in its place. In the last battle, he cut me off to attack an enemy I had spotted. I can not admit such behavior, each man has a definite place.
str_npc10_personalityclash2_speech|Captain, I have a question for you. Are you the leader, or is it {s11}?
str_npc11_personalityclash2_speech|Captain, {s11} has no place among us. After this last battle, he moved away mumbling a few pagan incantations as he was searching the bodies for our loot.
str_npc12_personalityclash2_speech|{Messire/Madame}, I can no longer tolerate the blatant ignorance shown in {s11}'s actions.
str_npc13_personalityclash2_speech|Hello captain, {s11} is insane, is he not? During our last battle, I uttered some sympathetic words to our enemies. Following which, I was got a lesson from him!
str_npc14_personalityclash2_speech|Friend, {s11} abused his eloquence to slander and falsely charge and accuse those who were better than himself.
str_npc15_personalityclash2_speech|Captain, I have to express my doubts about the qualities of {s11}. We can not trust him.
str_npc16_personalityclash2_speech|Forgive me captain, {s11} may have been a very clever thief in the past, but he does not have the balls of a warrior, if you want my opinion.
str_npc1_personalityclash2_speech_b|The way she whistles cheerfully as she does it -- it puts a chill down my spine, it does.
str_npc2_personalityclash2_speech_b|While the enemies were pushing us away, I heard hurtful words. Next time, I'll listen to a spear pierce his buffet!
str_npc3_personalityclash2_speech_b|After our last victory, I started to inspect the bodies and I recovered the purse of an enemy. As soon as I picked it up, it was torn from my hands. If I had just been asked for it, I would have given it without a story.
str_npc4_personalityclash2_speech_b|I think I have proven myself in combat. It is true that I am down to earth, and I am proud of it. If she does not understand that the respect of the other is important, one of these days I will launch him a plank of poisonous remarks of which it is likely not to recover.
str_npc5_personalityclash2_speech_b|I hate people with a high opinion of themselves while denigrating those who say they are of a poor background.
str_npc6_personalityclash2_speech_b|It's a useless waste of time, and because of that an enemy almost cut off his arm if I was not there to kill him in time. I recommend you lecture him, I do not want to have to entrust my life to men of confidence, even drunk or sick when there is a fight every man must hold the rank and cover his comrades.
str_npc7_personalityclash2_speech_b|I'm counting on you to shut his mouth.
str_npc8_personalityclash2_speech_b|I did say that I should be respected, and I heard this moron insulting me about you, you are warned, if he does not shut up, I will not be able to control myself any longer.
str_npc9_personalityclash2_speech_b|I appreciate being determined to risk his life in the battles, but that will not be enough to make him a real fighter. He has not the blood of a loyal knight.
str_npc10_personalityclash2_speech_b|In this last battle, I saw that I was being shouted at. When I said leave me alone, I heard that I would be whipped. Captain, with all due respect, I want to make him taste my steel.
str_npc11_personalityclash2_speech_b|He told me it was a prayer of praise for victory, but I did not hear it that way. Captain, I do not want him to wake up the dead to torment us during the trip. I think you'd better get rid of him.
str_npc12_personalityclash2_speech_b|One should know that one should never take out his weapon with the left hand, it brings bad luck. I have seen him do it several times despite my warnings which no account is held. And each time I have to pray to ward off the spell, but meditate that I'm not always here to see it. If you wanted to exclude him from the group, you would be of service to us all.
str_npc13_personalityclash2_speech_b|When all the dust fell, {s11} turned to me, telling me not to provoke the wrath of heaven with my fits of pride and swearing. I told him that at least I had not hurt myself with my weapon accidentally as it happens to him regularly. On that, {s11} tried to hit me, it's intolerable.
str_npc14_personalityclash2_speech_b|It's a sign of a bad soul. He must behave as it should be with all people, otherwise I will shut his mouth off.
str_npc15_personalityclash2_speech_b|Captain, no one would testify to such a lack of respect for his companions. Her place is not in a company like ours, I hear that a caravan follower has quite its place among us, but from the fact that it participates in the battles I am puzzled..
str_npc16_personalityclash2_speech_b|After the last battle, I cut the throats of some dying enemies, but it was to avoid them suffering too long. I would not tolerate anyone taking me for a beast.
str_npc1_personalitymatch_speech|{Sir/Madame}. I must admit that {s11} is quite an admirable fellow from what I've seen of him these past days.
str_npc2_personalitymatch_speech|{Messire/Madame}, I just wanted to talk to you about {s11}. He is violent, he is an inveterate rascal, but having said that, I am proud that he is my companion.
str_npc3_personalitymatch_speech|Greetings, {sir/madame}. I've been wanting to tell you for some time that {s11} has caught my eye. Did he not fight bravely in our last battle?
str_npc4_personalitymatch_speech|Excuse me, {sir/madame}. I just wanted to say a word in praise of {s11}. He did well in that last battle.
str_npc5_personalitymatch_speech|That was a fine battle, {playername}! {s11} is a good soldier to have by our side in a fight.
str_npc6_personalitymatch_speech|Captain, sometimes I think of this constant hunt for the enemy that we have undertaken, and in that I support you. That said, I think that death is only a mild punishment for the atrocities of war.
str_npc7_personalitymatch_speech|Captain, I have been talking a lot with {s11}. We can blame him for a lot of things, but behind that appearance is a person who has suffered and thus a good person who can be counted on.
str_npc8_personalitymatch_speech|Ah ah! the last battle was glorious, leader, was not it? I appreciated that {s11}, caught in a destructive rage, fells three enemies at once next to me.
str_npc9_personalitymatch_speech|{Messire/Madame}, {s11} made a very good impression during our last battle. It is a pleasure to fight with him, and I am proud to have him with us, I hope you are of my opinion.
str_npc10_personalitymatch_speech|Captain, {s11} defends himself well, I have seen him make very good passes during the last fight, I would like to teach him some more to perfect himself.
str_npc11_personalitymatch_speech|Captain, a battle of this intensity can perforce men and make them perplexed. Finally, I'm talking about the survivors, but we beat them, right?
str_npc12_personalitymatch_speech|Great massacre, {sire/madame}, beautiful massacre, very necessary. I think {s11} shares my perplexity over these perpetual clashes.
str_npc13_personalitymatch_speech|{playername}, we can blame many things at {s11} but I think I understand it, and it is crazy to be crazy, he just suffocated and he simply created a world to him.
str_npc14_personalitymatch_speech|Friend, it's a pleasure to fight with braves like {s11}.
str_npc15_personalitymatch_speech|Captain, I exchanged a few words with {s11} after our last battle, and I can tell you that it is a great asset to have him with us.
str_npc16_personalitymatch_speech|Hey captain, I chatted with {s11} during the search of corpses left in our last battle.
str_npc1_personalitymatch_speech_b|His valor and chivalry are remarkable, and when it is possible for me to set up my company of mercenaries, I would like to convince him to accompany me.
str_npc2_personalitymatch_speech_b|With what I saw in the last battle, I think I can trust him to protect my back. However, I will still keep a hand on my purse.
str_npc3_personalitymatch_speech_b|I also admit that {s11}'s company is comforting, {Sire/ Madame}.
str_npc4_personalitymatch_speech_b|You did well to enlist him in the troop. He also understands the importance of respecting his brothers in arms, regardless of the past or the suffering of each, not like some I will not mention.
str_npc5_personalitymatch_speech_b|Our partner deserves his place in our company, we must rejoice to have him with us.
str_npc6_personalitymatch_speech_b|I must confess that {s11} is for me a source of comfort, and his wisdom enlightening. The only member who understands me and agrees to drink with me, just for that I am happy with his presence in our company.
str_npc7_personalitymatch_speech_b|When you will not need our services, she promised me that we would continue to see each other. I think we still have a lot to say and share.
str_npc8_personalitymatch_speech_b|It put me in the saddle from the start and it has ended well, very nice battle.
str_npc13_personalitymatch_speech_b|Even though I often prefer reserved people to extroverts, I could not help but notice his effort to hide his character behind his warlike attitude.
str_npc14_personalitymatch_speech_b|Remarkable, I saw him in battle, piercing the enemy from one end to the other, so much so that the tip of his sword came out of his ass.
str_npc15_personalitymatch_speech_b|War, like any other business, requires careful preparation. I can guarantee it, everyone will learn to say thank you.
str_npc16_personalitymatch_speech_b|He is a good person, if he withdraws alone in the forest at times, it is because he flees the violence and madness of men, and he has more affinity with nature wild, I find it very touching.
str_npc1_retirement_speech|I did not make the right choice by accompanying you, I have decided to leave you.
str_npc2_retirement_speech|The warrior's life is getting boring, I'm going to leave you.
str_npc3_retirement_speech|I'm afraid I have something to say, I think you're not made to be a captain. I will leave you, {Messire/madame}.
str_npc4_retirement_speech|{Messire/Madame}, I did my part of work with you with honor, but I must leave you. Too many differences have accumulated, too many contradictions to my beliefs in fighting the injustice of war.
str_npc5_retirement_speech|I fought with perseverance and devotion at your side. However, I feel that you are not the ideal companion. So I decided to leave you.
str_npc6_retirement_speech|I joined this company in the hope of continually confronting myself to death by fighting as many enemies as possible, even in excess, but this was not always the case. There are subtleties that escape me. I will have to leave you.
str_npc7_retirement_speech|I'm tired of this life, I miss my independence and being alone in the forest, so I'll have to leave you.
str_npc8_retirement_speech|I fought under your banner, with great success it seems to me. Nevertheless, your command is not always at my convenience, so I will have to leave you.
str_npc9_retirement_speech|{Messire/Madame}, we fought well together, these many victories gave us glory. On the other hand, I have some reservations about your way of ordering. I was hoping for a more subtle command from you. So I'm going to have to leave you here, but maybe we'll see each other again.
str_npc10_retirement_speech|I am tired of walking these lands up and down and up and down. I will leave you, good luck to you for the future.
str_npc11_retirement_speech|You have done me a great service by taking me into your group. But I'm afraid this life does not suit me anymore, so I'll leave you.
str_npc12_retirement_speech|I enjoyed fighting the devil under your orders. I have fulfilled all my part in your mission and part of mine. I widened my knowledge, but I warned you that I could not stand the hympie behaviors. So I decided to leave you.
str_npc13_retirement_speech|I'm going to leave you {my friend/madame}, not because I don't like you, but because I decided to change my life.
str_npc14_retirement_speech|Friend, I inform you that I wish to leave you. I intend to look for another group that would know more about looting and looking for all kinds of loot.
str_npc15_retirement_speech|Thank you for using my services, but I have not always agreed with all the decisions that have been made. I will have to leave you.
str_npc16_retirement_speech|I had a good time among your troops, but it's time I move on, I have to leave you. With my earnings, I intend to settle near a garrison of a rich castle, hoping to catch the attention of some officers, he will be keen to help a poor lady in the distress, if you understand what I mean, and too bad for their throats.
str_npc1_rehire_speech|It's good to see you again. I know we've had some differences of opinion in the past, but to tell you the truth, it's sad to admit, but it was within your company that I had the most enjoyment. Listen, if you would take me back under your orders, you can count on my commitment again.
str_npc2_rehire_speech|{Messire/Madame}, nice to see you again. But I confess you, I was looking for you. In short, far from your company nothing is better for me. I believe that my destiny is to fight for survival. So tell me, {Sire/Madame}, would you take me back to the band?
str_npc3_rehire_speech|Hello {Messire/Madame}, it's a pleasure to see you again. I'm afraid I have not made much progress since we left each other. Maybe the war is my only refuge, and I have to ask you if you would like to take me back with you?
str_npc4_rehire_speech|Hello {Messire/Madame}, it's been a while since we've seen each other. For my part, I have not managed to find a commitment worthy of the name. I thought you could hire me again. Your reputation is great and a lot of flattering words are circulating on you. It would be an honor for a seasoned peasant to fight again in your ranks.
str_npc5_rehire_speech|Captain, we hear nothing but praise for you. So I decided to come back here, in the hope that you still allow me to fight with you.
str_npc6_rehire_speech|It's good to see you again, Captain. Wherever I go, everyone is in awe of your course. For me, everything was not very rosy, I even had my throat that was dry more than three days, rather go to hell than relive such a situation. I was well within your troop, so will you allow me to serve you again?
str_npc7_rehire_speech|Leader! it's a great pleasure to see you again. Forgive what I was able to tell you when we separated. Would you accept me to come back?
str_npc8_rehire_speech|Hey {playername}! I wondered if you could forget the few hard words that we could exchange in the past and what all the bad languages could say about me. I miss this company, can I fight again with you?
str_npc9_rehire_speech|{Messire/Madame}, it's a delight to see you again. I undertook to serve under the orders of other companies, but I have only found a painful disappointment. None had the guts to cope in lower numbers. So I decided to meet you and see if you would let me join you again.
str_npc10_rehire_speech|Captain, it gives me pleasure to see you again. As you can see, I'm back. I believe that what I do best is to fight. So tell me, captain, are you still looking for good companions?
str_npc11_rehire_speech|Captain, it's a pleasure to see you again. Everyone says you have a great future. I left you but I realize that it was not so bad to eat to his fill, to have honest companions and to see the enemy flee at our sight. So, you would hire me again?
str_npc12_rehire_speech|{Messire/Madame}, an honest face like yours is a pleasure to see. This world is filled with liars and possessed who do not keep their promises, finally I was good with you. Do you agree that I reintegrate your ranks?
str_npc13_rehire_speech|Greetings {playername}, I was hoping to see you again someday. Wherever I go, I hear stories of your exploits and songs in your honor. I admit that I felt a bit of regret when our roads separated. I told myself that I could possibly fight once again at your side. Would you agree that we were riding and that we were drinking together for a while?
str_npc14_rehire_speech|Friend!, it's a pleasure to see you again. I tried to join other groups, but they fell or were dissolved, do you still want me in your troupe?
str_npc15_rehire_speech|Hello {playername}, I can say that it is a pleasure to see you again. Just imagine that I accepted a commitment for another contract, and when it came time for my pay, we had nothing but a worthless apology and petty complaints, never a cent. Do you still offer work?
str_npc16_rehire_speech|Captain, here you are with a solid reputation. I will not lie to you, everything has degenerated very quickly in my new place of residence, Some legitimate ones have regrouped to make a scandal, they even wanted to make me burn like witch. I did everything to find you to ask you if you still wanted me in the group.
str_npc1_home_intro|{Messire/Madame}, did you know that I was from this region? It is here that I learned to have the eye and to make my first horseback riding.
str_npc2_home_intro|{Messire/Madame}, we are approaching a beautiful place, that's where I loved to come and relax in my youth.
str_npc3_home_intro|{Messire/Madame}, do you smell it? Good fresh air, the fragrance of freedom. In my younth, I spent a lot of very pleasant summers here. I used to play in the gardens of my mother's family while my father was elsewhere working hard.
str_npc4_home_intro|{Messire/Madame}, we are very close to what remains of my past, a scorched earth.
str_npc5_home_intro|Captain, this is the region where I grew up, and where I became a soldier and later merchant with the family of wholesalers in Bordeaux.
str_npc6_home_intro|Captain, we are near my home, I see the landscapes and vineyards that adorn the slopes of the hills.
str_npc7_home_intro|Chief, it's here in Nemours that I grew up, my family was a bunch of scoundrels and a worthless bunch, but it was my family.
str_npc8_home_intro|I remember my first time here, and a flood of questions drowned my mind.
str_npc9_home_intro|{Messire/Madame}, contemplate this landscape and this magnificent fortress. It was here that my father confronted an English army that was attempting to advance inland from the river bank. It was a bygone time when chivalry made sense, and where honor was above greed.
str_npc10_home_intro|{Messire/Madame}, you did not feel that fresh air, it was my home, before I left to make money.
str_npc11_home_intro|{Messire/Madame}, I see familiar hills, we must come near my home.
str_npc12_home_intro|{Messire/Madame}, we pass by the place which was the scene of a bloody battle.
str_npc13_home_intro|Hey, friend ... ah, what a beautiful place, fertile land where I have sunk so many happy days.
str_npc14_home_intro|Friend, the rebellion had established an important camp in this region.
str_npc15_home_intro|{Messire/Madame}, do you see the castle on the horizon? I worked there not so long ago, it is the most successful stone building that you will be able to see.
str_npc16_home_intro|Captain, do you see that? Traces of hares in the snow, and the smell of apple trees, we must be close to the place of my birth.
str_npc1_home_description|But hey, that's all in the past.
str_npc2_home_description|But hey, that's all in the past.
str_npc3_home_description|But hey, that's all in the past.
str_npc4_home_description|I already told you what had happened to my farm and my family. I can not forget these atrocities. That there are battles in a war, it makes sense, but that one behaves in such a savage way by plundering, there I say no.
str_npc5_home_description|It's a good place to live, but coming back here after I've been taken out of business for no good reason fills me with rage.
str_npc6_home_description|I did not have a very happy childhood, my parents being very poor. I had to get to work early. Anyway, everyone was suffering from these famines and the fear that the plague would make its devastating return. We could only survive thanks to the grapes and the sweet liquid that we drew from them.
str_npc7_home_description|We hunted for our pittance in the land of the Lord, is it really a crime to hunt?
str_npc8_home_description|We kill each other here as everywhere else, just for any excuse at hand.
str_npc9_home_description|But hey, that's all in the past. Now we must do everything to eradicate the impure knights from an immoral nobility. That's why I'm with you, and I'm hoping that together we can do it.
str_npc10_home_description|But hey, that's all in the past.
str_npc11_home_description|But hey, that's all in the past.
str_npc12_home_description|With some colleagues, we exchanged some of our techniques, in other words we quarrel again when the distant noise finally reached us.
str_npc13_home_description|But hey, that's all in the past.
str_npc14_home_description|We were for a moment at least two miles, no, maybe ten miles, then we were discovered, probably denounced by some peasants believed to be able to deal with the enemy, later we were encircled by a gigantic army of Englishmen and Burgundians ... it was a carnage, and the few prisoner survivors were forcibly enlisted as laborers in the construction of walls of fortifications, I was one of them, and later I followed my road finally released by a an important French army going on a raid ... and do you know the most strange {sire/madame}? A woman was leading them ... I swear!
str_npc15_home_description|But hey, that's all in the past.
str_npc16_home_description|The snow in these valleys does not melt until the end of spring, but the land is good and fortunately is not difficult to plow. The fruit trees grow without difficulty.
str_npc1_home_description_2|And I have no desire to talk about it, at least not now.
str_npc2_home_description_2|And I have no desire to talk about it, at least not now.
str_npc3_home_description_2|And I have no desire to talk about it, at least not now.
str_npc4_home_description_2|I know what you are going to tell me, that all of this is part of a voluntary strategy to destroy the economy. But being able to destroy in no time what had to be built for years proves how primitive the military are. So I'm happy to be able to fight them by your side, and I'm sure you understand my desire for revenge.
str_npc5_home_description_2|And then there is this war between the English and the French, and it disturbs my rebellious spirit, hope it does not last a hundred years otherwise it will ruin me. One day I will return to Bordeaux, and if by a miracle I get out of it, either I invest my crowns in a boat, or simply as a sailor in a merchant ship.
str_npc6_home_description_2|And then one day a royal company stopped in our village to hire henchmen. I was captivated by what the recruiters were saying, they promised mountains and wonders, alcohol afloat, free women. Commit yourself, heck that they said. And I did it. That's how I started my career as a mercenary.
str_npc7_home_description_2|I might have stolen the food at the tavern by killing the innkeeper, I would have done less in a dungeon.
str_npc8_home_description_2|But for once the reason seems right, everyone thinks it's time to force the English to let go of the balls of this country.
str_npc9_home_description_2|Thus I will be able to turn my head high on my land after having proved that noble sentiments prevail over the nobility, and that true bravery is worth an army.
str_npc10_home_description_2|And I have no desire to talk about it, at least not now.
str_npc11_home_description_2|And I have no desire to talk about it, at least not now.
str_npc12_home_description_2|We went there when the battle ended, we had work all night with the priests present, it was a memory of the most traumatic.
str_npc13_home_description_2|And I have no desire to talk about it, at least not now.
str_npc14_home_description_2|She looked like a madwoman, she told us to rebel and give our lives for France, what is even more strange you see is that most of my companions followed these consseils and went to war against the war, as she said ...
str_npc15_home_description_2|And I have no desire to talk about it, at least not now.
str_npc16_home_description_2|Yet our incomes were slim, and there were always too many mouths to feed around us. It was the lords of the surrounding areas who took everything with their exorbitant taxes. From the powerful wealthy, to the humble laborer.
str_npc1_home_recap|Although I am noble or of minor nobility, I grew up on the farm of my parents in Blois, but very early I preferred the sword to the pitchfork.
str_npc2_home_recap|I was born in Paris, where I spent most of my life. I learned weapons in the Barracks when I was little, when I brought  beer to  soldiers in exchange to lessons.
str_npc3_home_recap|Brittany is my birthplace, like many of my brothers and sisters. However, unlike them, my two parents are of noble blood.
str_npc4_home_recap|I am Enguerrand, we had a prosperous farm, but my farm was burned and my family was massacred by soldiers. I have a great desire for revenge that I must satiate.
str_npc5_home_recap|My name is Hermance, I come from Bordeaux, and I left it because of my hatred of those who dispossessed me and also attracted by adventure.
str_npc6_home_recap|I am Guillaume de Bourges, captain. I blame myself for being the only survivor of the massacre of my old mercenary company. I am a victim of this stupid war. There are times when I would have preferred to be killed in battle rather than being the only survivor of the battle that cost the lives of my comrades, but sometimes I think life is a beautiful thing.
str_npc7_home_recap|My name is Pierrick, I come from Nemours and I am a hunter, name the enemies who are trying to hide from you and I will track them down for you.
str_npc8_home_recap|My mother gave me life in Scotland, and she stayed there with my so-called father.
str_npc9_home_recap|I am Gael de Bourbon, noble of France, knight of Toulouse where I was born, where I grew up and founded false hopes on a corpulent world, but that joy and determination be mine, I am on the true road of chivalry, far from corruption. I am on the path of redemption.
str_npc10_home_recap|I was born near Monterean. I have been a fencing master for many lords and knights in the castle since the age of twenty.
str_npc11_home_recap|I'm a blacksmith, or at least I was, now I'm a bounty hunter, and nowadays, marauders are the ones I hit on my anvil.
str_npc12_home_recap|I am a Physician, and my mission is to save all patients, whoever they may be afflicted with various plagues, to the priests and to God to judge them afterwards.
str_npc13_home_recap|I'm Mathieu, a cold-blooded, mercenary killer and so many other things that are not worth mentioning. Let's just keep drinking before a blade pierces our belly.
str_npc14_home_recap|I am Michael of Chartres son of Simon the blacksmith, I am a Rebel, and I would not stop fighting until the invaders are thrown back into the sea.
str_npc15_home_recap|I was born in Paris and studied modern war machines. I also have some skills in literature and Latin.
str_npc16_home_recap|Well captain, my name is Blanche, just Blanche. I was born in a village near Peronne, my mother and my sisters were servants in the castle of a perverse nobleman, until I seized it all alone by my charms. so where a company could not have taken this castle I follow there arrived. I have been given many nicknames, but the one that suits me best is the White Viper.

str_npc1_kingsupport_1|It's a great idea, sir. When I think of all these kings and all these noble owners, with their prisons, their gallows and their scaffolds, the very ones who do not hesitate to whip, brand or hang a man who steals bread, even a horse, just to relieve the crying of children. France deserves better.
str_npc2_kingsupport_1|Well, Captain, I will support you. I think that you will exercise on France the enlightened power which has been so lacking for so long.
str_npc3_kingsupport_1|Well {my Lord/my Lady}, I was worried about you. Our history reveals to us that power tends to corrupt. But finally, I see that you have shown clemency and discernment in your duties as captain of this company.
str_npc4_kingsupport_1|Well, {Messire/Madame}, I think you'll be a {Duke/Duchess} whom people on earth like me would be proud to honor, and follow in battle to defend your dreams.
str_npc5_kingsupport_1|It's a great idea, it's time to think of something other than to go to war. We must stop all those fools who want to impose their powers, only on their profits. Let us dream of a world in peace where everyone has his place and the freedom to live wherever he likes.
str_npc6_kingsupport_1|I do not know if your claim is legitimate, but I think that unlike the others, you are able to lead a Duchy and protect it from these incessant wars, between nobles and between brothers, wars that will eventually annihilate us all.
str_npc7_kingsupport_1|Yes, you will be up to it. You know how to understand the common people, you have faith and laws, so you will make a good {Duke/Duchess}.
str_npc8_kingsupport_1|You would be a better governor than anyone else.
str_npc9_kingsupport_1|Very well {Messire/madame}. Nobody did anything for me when I collapsed in this tavern where we met. Therefore I am convinced that you would be a good {Duke/Duchess}, {Sire/Madame}, because you have a noble soul.
str_npc10_kingsupport_1|Well {Messire/madame}, I guess you need monarchs, so I think you'd be an excellent {Duke/Duchess}.
str_npc11_kingsupport_1|Excellent idea, {Capitain/Lady Captain}!In this case, I guess I should call you My {Lord/Lady} or Your Grace.
str_npc12_kingsupport_1|You would certainly be a very good {Duke/Duchess}, {Sire/Madame}. I am seldom mistaken about people, I find that your sense of compassion and the need to chase devils far exceeds that of these other so-called monarchs.
str_npc13_kingsupport_1|That would be a great thing, {friend/madame}! There are many stories of heroes who have shown themselves worthy of being noble thanks to their bravery.
str_npc14_kingsupport_1|Do it, friend, that your name decorated is sung by all the quinces of France. In my opinion, you are worthy of being {duke/duchess}, and may raise an important army to pay these traitors of English and Burgundy.
str_npc15_kingsupport_1|Well, when you can, you pay your men on time. In my opinion, this is the best definition of sovereignty. You respect the rights of others.
str_npc16_kingsupport_1|Why not, captain? You will certainly make an excellent {Duke/Duchess}. And I hope you will remember the little people who, like me, have contributed to your accession to the throne.
str_npc1_kingsupport_2|Certainly, {Messire/Madame}. But let me tell you what could rally other people to your cause, although I'm a little nobility I do not forget my roots, and the behavior of the lords Dukes and Counts is most despicable, why could not we not to assure the government of a region with justice and righteousness, a person such as you Messire would be perfect for that.
str_npc2_kingsupport_2|For the income of most lords of this country, say that they come exclusively from rent or looting. You, on the other hand, have the experience of the trade, the efforts and the risks necessary to ensure that the population of Tours does not die of hunger while Bourges is full of grain, it is an example. If you like, captain, I think I can find you some support among the merchants and bourgeois.
str_npc3_kingsupport_2|Yes {my lord/my lady}. But I would urge you to restore an old imperial tradition, the council of the nobility and the people, representing both the nobles of the country and the educated men of the people, and having the power to annul any new taxes or other tyrannical measures. likely to tempt you. It would be for your good, {my lord/my lady}.
str_npc4_kingsupport_2|{Messire/Madame}, it is now about rallying other people to your cause. As you know, the value and respect of an individual depends primarily on his work and not on his birth. It is important to make known your consideration for the work of the land, and your aversion to the misdeeds of war.
str_npc5_kingsupport_2|Certainly captain. let me tell you what could rally other people to your cause. When you become a {Duke/Duchess}, we will petition everyone and provide some gold to all your subjects to revive the economy, my friends artisans and traders will appreciate.
str_npc6_kingsupport_2|Yes, to all those who would be ready to listen to the story of your actions in favor of the right to live and consume what we want in these countries. I will talk about your ability to lead men against all odds, and I will tell them that if you become {Duke/Duchess}, the taverns would be free to offer anything that is good for the well-being of men, at least in this duchy.
str_npc7_kingsupport_2|Yes, the duty of a {Duke/Duchess} is to watch over the safety of his subjects, especially the weakest. If you were {Duc / Duchess}, your payasans would not need to steal their food.
str_npc8_kingsupport_2|And that's because you know it's not as difficult as all those unchangeable nobles say, that's the reason! you would end up being {Duke/Duchess} that it would not surprise me, it will be enough to govern by the politics of terror, so the brigands will fear you and go and plunder all, and the subjects will do what you say without rechinier, voila ... and to say that everyone thinks it's complicated, it puts me in a black jar just thinking about it.
str_npc9_kingsupport_2|Yes {Messire/Madame}, this is my opinion. You must promise everyone that the nobility will have to respect their ancient rights, their sense of honor and a chivalry purified of gangrene. For the moment there is a shambles in Europe, but it must be said that this will not always be the case. It is therefore a matter of simplifying things, first of all, the sovereign guarantor of the rank and property of each, then the honor of the lords and their chivalry, and finally all the others.
str_npc10_kingsupport_2|Certainly {Messire/Madame}. But I have an idea to submit to you. If you become {Duke/Duchess}, I would ask you to open your court to the people, not just the lords and the blue-blooded people. I would ask you to proclaim that every man judged and sentenced has the right to appeal directly to you. The lords are currently enjoying this right and I would like it to be extended to all.
str_npc11_kingsupport_2|Of course, you would make an excellent {Duke/Duchess}, you would guarantee peace in your lands and hunt down the wretches, but I am sure that no one will be hanged without judgment, as expeditious as it is.
str_npc12_kingsupport_2|Of course {Messire/Madame}, but if I learned anything during my travels, it is good that the French are straddling the tradition and the fact that the evil must be atoned. Everything must be done for that.
str_npc13_kingsupport_2|Um ... yes! I could travel and count our exploits in the taverns, is this what you want?
str_npc14_kingsupport_2|Yes, how would you be {Duke/Duchess} of all the lands you want to unite, but I would stay home. If there were problems with land, cattle, or blood, you'd let us do it in a hurry without you getting involved.
str_npc15_kingsupport_2|Yes, we may blame you for not having noble blood in your veins. What I do know is that noble blood makes miserly. Kings and nobles borrow money or order construction projects without worrying about how they will pay all those commoners who hope to eat after an honest day's work. If you want my opinion, it's honesty that makes a good {Duke/Duchess} and not genealogy.
str_npc16_kingsupport_2|Of course captain, what's more, I think a girl like me is doing you a favor by offering you the support of the stewards of the lords of this country. I may have been little involved in their plans and intrigues lately, but I think I know what they want. And given the secrets that I know, they are not likely to deny me entry to their honorable halls, right?
str_npc1_kingsupport_2a|Please, keep going.
str_npc2_kingsupport_2a|Continue.
str_npc3_kingsupport_2a|Continue.
str_npc4_kingsupport_2a|Of course.
str_npc5_kingsupport_2a|Please, keep going.
str_npc6_kingsupport_2a|Great.
str_npc7_kingsupport_2a|Compassion is a priority.
str_npc8_kingsupport_2a|Okay.
str_npc9_kingsupport_2a|This seems reasonable.
str_npc10_kingsupport_2a|Of course.
str_npc11_kingsupport_2a|That sounds right.
str_npc12_kingsupport_2a|Interesting, keep going.
str_npc13_kingsupport_2a|Well yes.
str_npc14_kingsupport_2a|OK, keep going.
str_npc15_kingsupport_2a|That is well spoken.
str_npc16_kingsupport_2a|Interesting, continue.
str_npc1_kingsupport_2b|Well, we saw what it gave.
str_npc2_kingsupport_2b|I do not want their support
str_npc3_kingsupport_2b|There is no question.
str_npc4_kingsupport_2b|Hum, not so simple.
str_npc5_kingsupport_2b|You want to ruin us!
str_npc6_kingsupport_2b|Impossible and unacceptable
str_npc7_kingsupport_2b|It's not just farmers, it's not the most influential ...
str_npc8_kingsupport_2b|Always as good! but i think i will keep your ideas for later.
str_npc9_kingsupport_2b|I doubt that your idea is so simple to apply.
str_npc10_kingsupport_2b|I'll think about it
str_npc11_kingsupport_2b|There are so many intrigues, not just looters.
str_npc12_kingsupport_2b|Enough, the evil has nothing to do with the case.
str_npc13_kingsupport_2b|Hum, I do not know.
str_npc14_kingsupport_2b|There is justice for that.
str_npc15_kingsupport_2b|{Duke/Duchess} of clerks, no.
str_npc16_kingsupport_2b|This can wait.
str_npc1_kingsupport_3|If I travel this country for a few weeks announcing to the people that you intend to consider them as subjects of your Duchy, they will begin to talk about you as a reformer, and this will open the way for you to found a Duchy. Should I do it, sir?
str_npc3_kingsupport_3|Such a promise on your part, {Mesire/Madame}, would help many of the lords of this country to overcome their reluctance. If you plan to restore the old system, you will undoubtedly be a more legitimate ruler than all these usurpers. Give me a few weeks, {Messire/Madame}, and I will let the nobles and merchants of this country know that you intend to restore their old rights.
str_npc4_kingsupport_3|Yes, I believe in the need to fight all the military and their unnatural acts. If you give me a few weeks, I would travel to the villages and the countryside of these countries and I would say everywhere that you have the will to pursue and punish any action perpetrated against civil society. Obviously you will also be a fierce defender of the peasantry, even leaving the land redistributed.
str_npc5_kingsupport_3|If I travel this country for a while announcing to the people that you intend to amnesty everyone, and you will distribute a nest egg to all the subjects who did not have the chance to be born in the nobility. That you will respect the traditions of the regions, and if he asks for it giving them their independence. Should I handle it, captain?
str_npc6_kingsupport_3|So, although my family now considers me a stranger because I made the choice to become a mercenary, I had access through that to many addictions of the nobility, and I think I would be there still welcome. I will go across this country and tell anyone who will listen to me that when you are {Duke/Duchess}, you will do your utmost to protect the free movement of alcohol and the right to settle disputes with people. spoilsport. And I can assure you that you will have people to support you.
str_npc7_kingsupport_3|Chief, give me a few weeks to go to all the cities where I still have contact with the people even if my life was wild, I will tell everyone that when you unify these countries, you will protect them more effectively than these distracted lords.
str_npc8_kingsupport_3|Well then, give me a few weeks to walk around the country and make known that you will be a respectful governor of the barons and their old rights. as well as a charitable soul towards the weak, it will be necessary to sleep them at first.
str_npc9_kingsupport_3|It's perfectly reasonable, {Messire/madame}, and we'll be released from these damn conspirators and bankers. Instead of thinking only of plotting conspiracies that occupy all their time, they should fight for the glory of your sovereignty. Give me leave and I will inform the noble souls of this country that you wish to restore the old laws of honor. I bet they will be many to follow you in this fight.
str_npc10_kingsupport_3|Well {Messire/Madame}, give me a few weeks and I will go through this land to let the people know that you will righteously and justly, and that with you the nobility and the people will be equal before the law. Men will see you in {Duke/Duchess} and it's a good start to truly become one.
str_npc11_kingsupport_3|Perfect, I'll run the countryside and the cities to announce your plans to clean the trade routes and the bad neighborhoods, and that you wish to do justice.
str_npc12_kingsupport_3|But did you know, Messire, quinconce indulges in an experimental medicine is immediately accused of heresy, it is the evidence of narrow mindedness, it is necessary to change that, because the medicine and cler On the contrary, there is nothing divergent, they are just the thoughts of ignorant people, universities must be reopened as in Paris, it is a crime not to authorize research.
str_npc13_kingsupport_3|So, give me a few weeks to tell your story, paying a few mugs to the people, because the people love the simple things and not the beautiful talk, believe me.
str_npc14_kingsupport_3|Give me a few weeks and I'll let everyone know that it was fatally yours to unify France. To be Duke or Duchess one must have the capacity to rule over a whole group of peasants and nobles. And none other than you have such an ability, companion.
str_npc15_kingsupport_3|That makes me very happy. Here is what I propose to you. I have some knowledge in local guilds, they are men like me who rolled. Here's what I'll tell them, that you're honest. That you honor the job well done. That you will pay your debts. That you will not reduce your subjects to begging.
str_npc16_kingsupport_3|Give me a few weeks and I will tour the castles of my former employers. I will use my charm to sing to them a pretty walk on what you will do once {Duke/Duchess}, on all the old freedoms that you will restore. I will say that you will let the nobles rob their farmers, tax the merchants, wage war, spend without counting and without thinking of the next day! What do you say, captain?
str_npc1_kingsupport_objection|Chief, did you allow Enguerrand to tell the nobles that they will have rights over pastures, markets and forests? I admit that I do not like it very much. If you let him, he will erect in all the villages of the country gallows where will swing poor poor like me whose only crime is to have taken a bow to go hunting in the woods to feed the whole family.
str_npc2_kingsupport_objection|Captain, Renaud travels this country promising the lords that you let them settle their quarrels by force and violence. You know how it's going to end, is not it? Generally, it is the merchants and the travelers who take the roads connecting their fortresses who are trapped in their small quarrels. All pretexts are good for attacking caravans. I sincerely hope that it is a misunderstanding, {Messire/Madame}.
str_npc3_kingsupport_objection|Captain, Pierrick has embarked on a sort of expedition claiming that you approve of it. He says that he will go through the villages of this country to announce to their inhabitants that when you are {Duke/Duchess}, you will hang all thieves and bandits. {Messire/Madame}, I am a merchant's son and I know how much brigandage is a scourge. I also know that many have suffered great injustice. But you can not condemn men to hang so blindly. Clemency must have a place in your sovereignty.
str_npc4_kingsupport_objection|{Messire/Madame}, I have heard that you want to announce to all the burghers that you are claiming a duchy because you know how to invest gold to make it flourish. It's insane, they think only to maintain their situation, making fun of the misery of the peasants. I can only disapprove of this attitude.
str_npc5_kingsupport_objection|Captain, I heard what Renaud offered you, and I totally disagree, but not at all. It is a sprain to my convictions, moreover it will not have escaped you that he is suffering is not it.
str_npc6_kingsupport_objection|I know you've sent Gaspard to spread a rumor about your so-called noble origins. Know, captain, that I doubt that this is the best way to access lands and power.
str_npc7_kingsupport_objection|I heard what you said, you plan to let all the criminals appeal to the Duke / Duchess. I disapprove, especially for those responsible for intrigues, is to insult the common people.
str_npc8_kingsupport_objection|Chief, you have sent this moron to tell the lords of this country that you intend to impose a peace under which no one will have to settle his differences with the sword. Would you let us all die in our beds, touched by the scythe of time?
str_npc9_kingsupport_objection|{Messire/Madame}, it seems that you asked Hermance to warn the people that you would make all the crooked of the country free and that you would distribute the money from the crown to all the beggars. I hope this is a misunderstanding. {Messire/Madame}, if your future reign is to be a villain's paradise, I have no desire to live there.
str_npc10_kingsupport_objection|I learned that you asked William to invent stories and pay the people to justify your accession to the throne. I can only disapprove, {Messire/Madame}. If men are fighting for a ruler, it must be because they know they will get something positive, not because they had to drink for free.
str_npc11_kingsupport_objection|I have heard that you want to announce to the people that you will become {Duke/Duchess}, then lead an army across the mountains. Will these wars never end, {Messire/Madame}? I thought that by becoming {Duke/Duchess}, you would offer us a little peace. But I suppose heaven wants the blood of the French to be shed and their bones broken. In this case, we can only bow.
str_npc12_kingsupport_objection|{Sire/Madame}, I have heard that you have made Blanche a kind of ambassador of the aristocracy. I dare not imagine, even feigned, what this amoral girl might promise them on your behalf. It is an insult to all those who hoped that you would help France to escape this diabolical past to enter a new era of divine peace and knowledge of the Divine and respect for the sciences.
str_npc13_kingsupport_objection|I have heard that you have allowed Nortimer to make a presentation undermining everything that is dear to the people of this country and accusing former kings of murder and usurpation. Captain, I know that the people need heroes to admire and a golden age to recover. would you found a Duchy in which cynics and scholars will dictate to us what we must believe in? Nothing would be stupid anymore.
str_npc14_kingsupport_objection|You have sent to announce to all that under your rule, you will release all villains of this country. What a strange idea, companion, farmers and farmers will still be the first victims of this evil spell.
str_npc15_kingsupport_objection|It seems that you sent Florentin to spread nonsense about marks on your hands. I admit that it bothers me that you use such superstitions to support your claims. Villagers believe one thing one day and something else the next. That said, a horoscope seriously made by a famous astrologer from a royal university could reveal interesting things to you, but this has not been done in France for some time now.
str_npc16_kingsupport_objection|Hey captain, it seems that you will promise the merchants that you will serve France on a silver platter. I hope it's not serious. When a noble lord organizes a banquet, he always throws a few coins at the poor and makes sure that the servants return with their belly full. On the other hand, when a merchant marries his daughter, you can consider yourself happy if you keep a few crumbs. At least, from my experience.
str_npc1_intel_mission|Well, {Messire/Madam}, I happen to have cousins ​​at {s17}, and unlike other members of my family, they still support me. They sell horses, I even provided them with animals from time to time. And by exercising their craft in the castles and large rooms of the {S18}, they hear a lot of gossip. I could go spend a few days there to bring you some information.
str_npc2_intel_mission|{Messire/Madam}, if you're interested in {s18}, I can get in touch with my {s17} old business partners. They are generally well informed politically.
Captain, I can not go back to my dad at {s17}, but I can still get in touch with my sister. She will know what is going on in the big trading houses and will tell us more about the state of the {S18}.
str_npc4_intel_mission|{Messire/Madam}, if you could give me a few days, I'd like to get some information from an old peasant family at {s17}, she has special contacts with {s18}. She is a good housewife, who speaks little but listens a lot. I am sure that after a drink or two the patriarch could tell us what policy dominates these countries.
captain, if you wish, I can take a few days to visit a part of my family at {s17}, they still support me. They sell armor, and I know most of the craftsmen and merchants who practice in the castles and cities of the {S18}. They hear a lot of gossip, I could go spend a few days there to bring you some information.
captain, although I'm not much appreciated at {s17}, I could meet my former employers there. I have personally taken them out of a very delicate affair, and they now occupy an important place in society, they judge me much less severely than many others. If you give me a few days, I might be able to gather some interesting information about {s18}.
str_npc7_intel_mission|Chief, when I left my last home, in other words, in {s17}, I swore never to go back, but I happen to have contacts with the people in the neighborhood, they may reveal some useful information about {s18}.
str_npc8_intel_mission|If the events of {s18} interest you, one of my retired old comrades-in-arms now owns a farm near {s17}. He stayed in touch with other former warriors we will say. I could visit him a few days to find out more about what's going on there it will give me the opportunity to have a cooked.
It was a long time ago that I did not taste the delights of {s17} where people of good family like me have a high opinion of the hospitality of the most powerful and the most generous. If you wish, I can go there and inquire about the problems and concerns that plague the true nobility of {s18}.
captain, I think my old garrison comrades from {s17} would be happy to see me. They are upright men, incapable of betraying the city, but like me, they have no particular affection for the nobles who command them and will not hesitate to share some gossip with me. The little nobility is still fighting for trifles, but if there are real reasons for dissension, my friends will certainly know.
captain, I have not visited mine, {s17}, for a long time. They have always been very kind to me, especially in difficult times, so I would like them to enjoy what I have now. The grain merchants of Dijon know me well and trust me. If that interests you, I think they will not hesitate to reveal useful information about what is happening within {s18}.
str_npc12_intel_mission|With your permission, my Lord, I would like to visit one of my disciples, now serving the Lord of {s17}. I had high hopes for him, but I hear that he recently approved the use of the apple in the treatment of paralysis. This diabolical simulacrum of medicine imperatively requires my intervention. Once there, if you're interested, I can ask my student what's going on at {s17}.
str_npc13_intel_mission|{my friend / madam}, if possible, I would like to go to the neighboring valleys of {s17}. I try not to return to my old pastures, but I must confess that I would like to hear from a beautiful shepherdess of my acquaintance. On the way, I could stop at the castle. Thanks to my charm, I should have no trouble getting into the lord to glean some information about {s18} for you.
str_npc14_intel_mission|Friend, I have often scoured the supply of the {s17} garrison. The steward has invited me to visit him, in which he will give me information about what is happening within the {s18}. If you allow me, I would like to accept this invitation.
captain, as you may know, I'd like to go to {s17} to study its structure, one of the finest examples of the old style. It turns out that one of my colleagues is currently working on the repair of the perimeter wall. Although his professionalism prevents him, in my opinion, from revealing the least weakness in his defenses, which is to his credit, I think he would gladly give me an opinion on the general state of the {S18}, if that interests you.
str_npc16_intel_mission|Oh Captain, I want to visit my old friends of {s17}. I will simply say that the lord and lady of the place had asked me for some service, and had been a little lax about the payment. I do not want to put them in difficulty by letting them know the purpose of my visit, but I could have a little conversation with my old friend the steward who will let me in and talk to me about the {s18}.
str_npc1_fief_acceptance|Would you make me the lord of {s17}, my {lord/lady}? Well, that would be the nicest thing that has been done for me for a long time. Hey, I'll put my heart into it, I assure you. But I do not know what will be the reaction of other lords when they discover me.
str_npc2_fief_acceptance|{s17} as stronghold? Well, I know how to buy and sell, but not govern. That said, thinking about it, I think that with me this place could pay big. Thank you, my lord / madam, this is a very kind proposal from you.
str_npc3_fief_acceptance|Dear {Messire/Madame}, it's very generous of you to offer me {s17}. It is with great pleasure that I will take care of it and that I will watch over the moral and material well-being of its inhabitants.
str_npc4_fief_acceptance|It's generous for you to grant me {s17} as a fief. Your choice is judicious and a duchy can be proud to have as a vassal a man coming from the earth. You can count on me to administer this area without the help of the military.
str_npc5_fief_acceptance|Would you make me the lord of {s17} captain? Well, it would be the best gift we could dream of. I will put all my heart, I assure you. I do not know what will be the reaction of the other lords when they discover the august company of the rebel that I have become, in any case I will assume my new responsibilities.
str_npc6_fief_acceptance|Captain, I find it amazing that you deem me worthy to lead men while I have been receiving orders all my life. But if that is your wish, it will be a great honor for me to take care of {s17} on your behalf and to devote myself to the protection of its inhabitants. For that, I know the best and most efficient mercenaries in Europe.
str_npc7_fief_acceptance|Yes, I will take care of {s17} and build a reputation for him that will cause fear among plotters. Thank you for this opportunity, you are a governor worthy of the name.
str_npc8_fief_acceptance|Would you make me a governor? Well, I guess I can postpone the looting for the decoration of {s17} 's throne room. Do not worry, I'm joking, I'm okay with these people.
str_npc9_fief_acceptance|{Messire/Madame}, I lost a domain and a powerful family, but today with this offer I will be able to rebuild all this of my hands without the duty to anybody, justice of God is returned. It will be a great honor for me to serve you, fight and protect this fiefdom on your behalf.
str_npc10_fief_acceptance|Would you like to make me a lord? Well, no thanks. On the other hand, if you want me to become a tribune, a defender of the people, I may resolve to lead {s17} for you. I will feed the hungry and raise a force of infantry to fight on your behalf, {Messire/Madame}. But I doubt that the nobles appreciate my presence in your councils.
str_npc11_fief_acceptance|Ah! You would grant a title of nobility to a commoner? Well, I would be wrong to refuse. Life sometimes plays us funny tricks. Can you imagine a little? I would become someone in the kingdom of France!
str_npc12_fief_acceptance|Well {Mesire/Madame}, I am not in favor of the fiefdom system. Farmers and landowners should take care of their own affairs, under the distant gaze of the sovereign but in all communion with God. That being said, we have already known far too many usurpers possessed by Satan to take this risk. Give me the reins of this territory and I will do my best to eradicate all traces of the evil, even if it will take me some time to get there.
str_npc13_fief_acceptance|How nice and generous, {friend/madame}! Allow me to give thanks to your wisdom. Do you ... excuse me, but I do not feel fit, but I accept that it will be and we will advise later.
str_npc14_fief_acceptance|Would you make me a baron with a chasteau? Well, I will make men non-chalans to plow and cultivate the land. By virtue of not communicating to the misfortunes and miseries of their country. Icy I always do my home.
str_npc15_fief_acceptance|Well, {Messire/Madame}, this is a very generous act that makes you the kind of monarch able to save this country from the current incompetence. I fear that many noble local lords think that a commoner like me is not worthy of running a fief. But when they see what I do and the income I get, they will change their attitude!
str_npc16_fief_acceptance|Oh how generous, captain! I attended many rooms of honor and domains, not always with the permission of the mistress of the place, I admit it, but never I would have dared to dream to own one myself. Let me think, when I receive my first annuity, what can I afford, the most beautiful court dress?
str_npc3_woman_to_woman|My lady, if you don't mind me saying -- I think by now you have proven yourself to be one of the great warriors of this realm. Yet strangely, no king has come forward to offer you a fief. Perhaps it is because you are a woman. No matter -- I personally believe that you will take your place among the great lords of this realm, even if you have to fight twice as long and twice as hard to receive your due!
str_npc7_woman_to_woman|Captain. If you don't mind me saying, you have fought long and hard against the scum of France, and with their defeat, you make this land a better place. You are well deserving of a fief of your own -- and I suspect that if you were not a woman, a king would have offered you one by now. That is the way of the men in this sorry land: they let us stand in the front of the battleline to take the enemy's blows, but when it comes to a division of the spoils, they expect us to head to the rear.
str_npc8_woman_to_woman|Excuse me, {playername}. I would like to offer you my congratulations -- it seems that you are well on your way to making a name for yourself as a warrior to be feared. If you were a man, I suspect the kings of this land would be falling over themselves to make you their vassal. Alas, in this world, women like ourselves must fight twice as hard to receive what is only our due.
str_npc11_woman_to_woman|Aye, lassie, I just can't help thinking to myself -- you've made quite a name for yourself, haven't you? Fighting and marching up and down the length of the land. Why, I suspect if you were a man, some king would have offered you a fief by now. Well, you may still get what you deserve -- you'll just have to prove yourself a bit more.
str_npc16_woman_to_woman|Oy, Captain -- if you don't mind me saying, you've made quite a name for yourself in these parts. I suspect that if you were a man, a king would have offered you a fief by now. But we ladies should come to expect things like that. Men will find any excuse not to reward us for our work, so if we take a fancy to a bit of land somewhere, maybe we should just reach out and take it. That's the way I look at the world, anyway.
str_npc1_turn_against|I regret that we found ourselves in such conditions, sir. There is no question that I owe you my ascension in life. You probably take me as ungrateful. But everyone must follow his destiny ... is not it?
str_npc2_turn_against|What a sad day! I never thought I would ever have to face my former captain on a battlefield. Even if I win, I will not get any glory.
str_npc3_turn_against|Oh {playername}, our lives have taken a very tragic turn! I only hope that at the end of this war, which today makes us enemies, we will become friends again.
str_npc4_turn_against|I do not know what to say. Just maybe it is unfortunate to oppose. If we must fight, we will have to finish it as soon as possible.
str_npc6_turn_against|What a misfortune to meet again under such conditions, captain. But I will not dwell on the circumstances that led us to this situation. I only hope that one day we can be together again, if of course each of us manages to live long enough.
str_npc7_turn_against|Well, chief, you made me a real warrior, and I'm grateful for that. But now that our interests diverge, I must fight you. Nevertheless, I hope that our agreement will continue whatever happens.
str_npc8_turn_against|So, here we are today enemies. Our shields will soon collide. That it is so goes to hell.
str_npc9_turn_against|I refuse to take responsibility for the circumstances that led us to become enemies. Know that I have a big heart but a clear conscience.
str_npc10_turn_against|Well, now fate leads me today to fight my former captain. Our relationship probably began to deteriorate when you became my overlord. I suppose that vassalage has never been my forte. Anyway, we are here today. Perhaps our friendship will be reborn one day, when the world has changed and there will be no masters or servants, no lords or vassals.
str_npc11_turn_against|Just heaven! So we are enemies, {young man/girl}! Life plays us a funny trick, is not it? A very cruel turn.
str_npc12_turn_against|So we will have to fight. Know, my lord, that I have never betrayed you. I did not serve the person, but the principles that I thought were yours, in perfect agreement with my mission. Alas, you gave it up. It is therefore my duty to do everything to stop you. I hope that once you have cast the devil out of your mind, our friendship will be reborn.
str_npc13_turn_against|I regret that we are today enemies, captain. But on the other hand, it's a rare privilege to fight a champion on the battlefield. Honestly, I think this fight will make bards and poets fat for months.
str_npc14_turn_against|Well Companion, you who had always been very fond of me, we are enemies. This encounter saddens me but I have the duty to fight you.
str_npc15_turn_against|Ah, I dreaded this day so much! If you had not stopped believing in me, we would certainly not be here today. But you probably see things differently.
str_npc16_turn_against|Hello Captain, well it looks like we are enemies! Since we have to face each other, I want to warn you that once the fight is underway, I sometimes have trouble controlling myself. But know that whatever I do, it's nothing personal. If we get away with it, maybe we'll be friends again someday, maybe a little more?
str_comment_intro_liege_affiliated|I am told that you are pledged to one of the pretenders who disputes my claim to the crown of France. But we may still talk.
str_comment_intro_famous_liege|Your fame runs before you! Perhaps it is time that you sought a liege worthy of your valor.
str_comment_intro_famous_martial|Your fame runs before you! Perhaps we shall test each other's valor in a tournament, or on the battlefield!
str_comment_intro_famous_badtempered|I've heard of you. Well, I'm not one for bandying words, so if you have anything to say, out with it.
str_comment_intro_famous_pitiless|I know your name. It strikes fear in men's hearts. That is good. Perhaps we should speak together, some time.
str_comment_intro_famous_cunning|Ah, yes. At last we meet. You sound like a good {man/woman} to know. Let us speak together, from time to time.
str_comment_intro_famous_sadistic|I know your name -- and from what I hear, I'll warrant that many a grieving widow knows too. But that is no concern of mine.
str_comment_intro_famous_goodnatured|I've heard of you! It's very good to finally make your acquaintance.
str_comment_intro_famous_upstanding|I know your name. They say you are a most valiant warrior. I can only hope that your honour and mercy matches your valor.
str_comment_intro_noble_liege|I see that you carry a {nobleman's/noble's} banner, although I do not recognize the device. Know that I am always looking for good {men/warriors} to fight for me, once they prove themselves to be worthy of my trust.
str_comment_intro_noble_martial|I see that you carry a nobleman's banner, but I do not recognize the device. No matter -- a brave {man's/warrior's} home is all the world, or so they say!
str_comment_intro_noble_badtempered|I don't recognize the device on your banner. No doubt another foreigner come to our lands, as if we didn't have so many here already.
str_comment_intro_noble_pitiless|I see that you carry a nobleman's banner, but I do not recognize the device. Another vulture come to grow fat on the leftovers of war, no doubt!
str_comment_intro_noble_cunning|I see that you carry a nobleman's banner, but I do not recognize the device. Still, it is always worthwhile to make the acquaintance of {men/women} who may one day prove themselves to be great warriors.
str_comment_intro_noble_sadistic|I see that you carry a nobleman's banner, but I do not recognize the device. Perhaps you are the bastard {son/daughter} of a puffed-up cattle thief? Or perhaps you stole it?
str_comment_intro_noble_goodnatured|I see that you carry a nobleman's banner, but I do not recognize the device. Forgive my ignorance, {sir/my lady}! It is good to make your acquaintance.
str_comment_intro_noble_upstanding|I see that you carry a nobleman's banner, but I do not recognize the device. No doubt you have come to France in search of wealth and glory. If this indeed is the case, then I only ask that you show mercy to those poor souls caught in the path of war.
str_comment_intro_common_liege|You may be of common birth, but know that I am always looking for good men to fight for me, if they can prove themselves to be worthy of my trust.
str_comment_intro_common_martial|Perhaps you are not of gentle birth, but even a commoner, be {he/she} of sufficient valor, may make something of {himself/herself} some day.
str_comment_intro_common_badtempered|Speak quickly, if you have anything to say, for I have no time to be bandying words with common soldiers of fortune.
str_comment_intro_common_pitiless|You have the look of a mercenary, another vulture come to grow fat on the misery of this land.
str_comment_intro_common_cunning|Well... I have not heard of you, but you have the look of a {man/woman} who might make something of {himself/herself}, some day.
str_comment_intro_common_sadistic|Normally I cut the throats of impudent commoners who barge into my presence uninvited, but I am in a good mood today.
str_comment_intro_common_goodnatured|Well, you look like a good enough sort.
str_comment_intro_common_upstanding|Peace to you, and always remember to temper your valor with mercy, your courage with honour.
str_comment_intro_female_famous_liege|I have heard much about you. Some men may fear a woman who is versed in the art of war, but I for one will not turn away hands that can grip a sword, should their owner be brave and loyal.
str_comment_intro_female_famous_martial|I have heard much about you. They say that you are the equal of even the bravest of men in your prowess at arms. Perhaps one day I shall try my valor against yours, either in a tournament or on the battlefield!
str_comment_intro_female_famous_badtempered|I've heard of talk of you -- the woman who knows how to fight like a man.
str_comment_intro_female_famous_pitiless|I know your name. It strikes fear in men's hearts. That is good. Perhaps we should speak together, some time.
str_comment_intro_female_famous_cunning|Ah, yes. At last we meet. You sound like a good woman to know. Let us speak together, from time to time.
str_comment_intro_female_famous_sadistic|I know your name -- and from what I hear, I'll warrant that many a grieving widow knows too. But that is no concern of mine.
str_comment_intro_female_famous_goodnatured|I've heard of you! It's very good to finally make your acquaintance.
str_comment_intro_female_famous_upstanding|I know your name. They say you are a most valiant warrior. I can only hope that your honour and mercy matches your valor.
str_comment_intro_female_noble_liege|It is not often that I meet a woman who aspires to lead men into battle. But these are dark and troubled times, and I for one will not turn away hands that can grip a sword, should their owner be brave and loyal.
str_comment_intro_female_noble_martial|I do not recognize the device on your banner, but clearly you are a lady of rank. Please consider me your most humble servant.
str_comment_intro_female_noble_badtempered|I don't recognize the device on that banner. Clearly another foreigner come to our lands, bringing their strange ways.
str_comment_intro_female_noble_pitiless|I see that you carry a noble's banner, but I do not recognize the device... You should know, lady, that in France it is the men to ride to war, and if you seek to overturn the natural order of things, you will find your fair head stuck on a pike -- like that of any other rebel!
str_comment_intro_female_noble_cunning|It is not unheard-of for a woman to seek her fortune on the battlefields of France, but neither is it usual. I shall be most interested in your progress.
str_comment_intro_female_noble_sadistic|You appear to be of noble rank, but I don't recognize your banner. Clearly, another foreigner come to our shores -- no doubt from a land where men are weak, and the women ride to war in their place!
str_comment_intro_female_noble_goodnatured|I see that you carry a nobleman's banner, but I do not recognize the device. Forgive my ignorance,, my lady! It is good to make your acquaintance.
str_comment_intro_female_noble_upstanding|It is not every day that we see a woman caparisoned for war. Please do not take this amiss, my lady, for you have every right to protect yourself, but I cannot pretend to be fully comfortable with your decision to fight in battle. I would prefer that women be untouched by these wars, as I believe the female to be the custodian of what little gentility and tenderness remains to us.
str_comment_intro_female_admiring_liege|It is not often that I meet a woman who aspires to lead men into battle. But these are dark and troubled times, and I for one will not turn away hands that can grip a sword, should their owner be brave and loyal.
str_comment_intro_female_admiring_martial|Greetings, my lady. Although I see from your demeanor that you are not a conventional maiden, I hope that you are not averse to a declaration of admiration from me, your most humble servant.
str_comment_intro_female_badtempered_admiring|Heh. Fancy this -- a maiden, all equipped for war. Well, it's a strange sight, but in your case, I can imagine that it might grow on me.
str_comment_intro_female_pitiless_admiring|It is unusual to see a woman girt for war. Be careful, my lady -- it is a harsh world, and it would be a shame to see such beauty marred by a sword-blow.
str_comment_intro_female_cunning_admiring|Greetings, my lady. Please do not think it forward, if I say that it is unusual to see a woman caparisoned for war. I hope that one day I may be the father of a daughter possessed of such bravery and spirit.
str_comment_intro_female_sadistic_admiring|What have we here! A woman, caparisoned for war! Well, I dare say that one as fair as you could lend a touch of femininity even to a mail hauberk.
str_comment_intro_female_admiring_goodnatured|My lady, if you are skilled as arms as you are fair in countenance, then your enemies should indeed fear you!
str_comment_intro_female_admiring_upstanding|Greetings, my lady. Even with the dust of the march upon your clothes and gear, I can see that you are not lacking in the graces of your noble sex.
str_comment_intro_female_common_liege|It is not often that I meet a woman who aspires to lead men into battle. But these are dark and troubled times, and I for one will not turn away hands that can grip a sword, should their owner be brave and loyal.
str_comment_intro_female_common_martial|I must say, my lady -- do be careful, riding about this dangerous land. If you ever wished to seek a more... em... settled life, I'm sure I could find you a worthy husband from among my men.
str_comment_intro_female_common_badtempered|By the way, girl -- does your husband know that you nicked his weapons and armor? I'll bet you're in for a right old beating when you get home!
str_comment_intro_female_common_pitiless|These are fallen times indeed, when even women turn brigand, to pick the leavings from the wreckage of war.

str_comment_intro_female_common_upstanding|It is not every day that we see a woman caparisoned for war. Please do not take this amiss, my lady, for you have every right to protect yourself, but I cannot pretend to be fully comfortable with your decision to fight in battle. I would prefer that women be untouched by these wars, as I believe the female to be the custodian of what little gentility and tenderness remains to us.
str_rejoinder_intro_female_common_badtempered|I won my weapons in battle. Would you care to test their edge?

str_rejoinder_intro_female_common_martial|I could find worthier husbands than those in a kennel.

str_comment_our_king_granted_you_a_fief_allied|I heard that {s54} granted you {s51} as a fief. You seem to be doing very well for yourself.
str_comment_you_renounced_your_alliegance_enemy_friendly|I heard that you renounced your allegiance to our lord, {s54}. It grieves me that we must now meet on the field of battle.
str_comment_you_renounced_your_alliegance_friendly|I heard that you renounced your allegiance to our lord, {s54}. Let us pray that we may not come to blows.
str_comment_you_renounced_your_alliegance_unfriendly_spiteful|I always had you figured for a traitor to {s54}, and now it seems I was proven right. I hope you are prepared to die a traitor's death!
str_comment_you_renounced_your_alliegance_unfriendly_moralizing|I heard that you renounced your allegiance to our lord, {s54}. I am forced to consider you a traitor.
str_comment_you_renounced_your_alliegance_enemy|I heard that you renounced your allegiance to our lord, {s54}. Well, it is the way of the world for old comrades to become enemies.
str_comment_you_renounced_your_alliegance_default|I heard that you renounced your allegiance to our lord, {s54}. Well, that is your decision, but do not expect me to go easy on you when we meet on the battlefield.
str_comment_you_claimed_the_throne_1_player_liege|My informants tell me that some people in this realm are speaking of you as the next king. I assume that you will quickly put a stop to such idle and dangerous talk.
str_comment_you_claimed_the_throne_2_player_liege|My informants tell me that some of your companions have telling the peasants that you have a claim to the throne. I sincerely hope that they have been acting without your orders.
str_comment_lord_intervened_against_me|It is well known that I had quarrel with {s54}, and {s50} ruled in my rival's favor.
str_comment_i_protested_marshall_appointment|It is well known that I had protested {s54}'s decision to appoint {s51} as marshal.

str_comment_i_quarreled_with_troop_over_woman|It is well known that {s51} paid suit to {s54}, while I was also courting her. He is unworthy of her attentions, and I intend to teach him to keep his distance from her.
str_comment_i_quarreled_with_you_over_woman_default|I hear that you have been paying suit to {s54}. I do not believe that you are worthy of a fair lady such as her, and would strongly encourage you to cease pursuing her.
str_comment_i_quarreled_with_you_over_woman_derisive|I hear that you have been paying suit to {s54}. Let me tell you something -- I've had my eye on that one ever since I was a lad, and she was a lass. She's a high-born lady of this realm, and should not be demeaned by a foreigner's crude attentions. Keep away from her, or expect to pay the price!
str_comment_player_suggestion_succeeded|I followed your suggestion, and profited much by your advice.
str_comment_player_suggestion_failed|I followed your suggestion and met with disaster, and I hold you responsible.
str_comment_you_enfiefed_a_commoner_hesitant|I understand that you have given {s51} to a commoner who calls himself {s54}. Be careful. To learn the art of governance is no easy task, and perhaps it is best that fathers pass it on to their sons. I advise you against tampering with the institution of lordship.
str_comment_you_enfiefed_a_commoner_derisive|I understand that you have given {s51} to a commoner who calls himself {s54}. Do not the ancients warn us against making royal robes out of the hides of pigs?
str_comment_you_enfiefed_a_commoner_nasty|I understand that you have given {s51} to a commoner who has taken the name of {s54}. Have a care! A dog may turn on its master.
str_comment_marriage_normal_family|Congratulations on your marriage to my {s11} {s50}. You may now consider yourself part of the family!
str_comment_marriage_normal|Congratulations on your marriage to {s50}. The news does credit to you both.
str_comment_marriage_normal_nasty|Well -- I see that you have married {s50}. She was always a silly girl, with appalling judgement.
str_comment_marriage_elopement_family|Well... You somehow persuaded my {s11} {s50} to marry you. I don't know what you did to make her accept you, but our family will not forget this humiliation.
str_comment_marriage_elopement_liege|I hear that you have eloped with {s50}, against her family's wishes. I am not pleased. Her family are among the great lords of my realm, and I do not like to see them made to look like fools.
str_comment_you_broke_truce_as_my_vassal|I hear that you have broken my truce by attacking {s55}. Do you know how this makes me look? If you were acting under my orders, I appear dishonorable. If you were not, I look weak. I have half a mind to indict you for treason here and now.
str_comment_you_attacked_neutral_as_my_vassal|I hear that you have attacked subjects of the {s55}. You have given them an excuse to attack me, if they want... We shall see what comes of this. A fine day's work you have done!

str_prisoner_released_default|You have my gratitude, {sir/madame}. I shall not forget your kindness.
str_prisoner_released_martial|You are indeed a {man/woman} of honour, {sir/madame}. I shall not forget this!
str_prisoner_released_quarrelsome|I'm free? Well... Good bye, then.
str_prisoner_released_pitiless|Thank you. When you are finally defeated, I will request for your death to be swift and merciful. Unless, that is, you care to join us... Good bye, for now.
str_prisoner_released_cunning|Am I? You are a good {man/woman}. I will try to find a way to repay you.
str_prisoner_released_sadistic|Am I? So refined is your cruelty, that you would rather see me free and humiliated, than in chains. Enjoy your triumph!

str_enemy_meet_goodnatured|What is your name, {sir/madame}? If we come to blows, I would know whom I fight.
str_enemy_meet_upstanding|Who are you, who would come in arms to dispute our righteous cause?
str_battle_won_default|You have proven yourself a most valued ally, today.
str_battle_won_martial|There is no greater fortune than the chance to show one's valor on the field of arms!
str_battle_won_quarrelsome|Hah! We showed those bastards a thing or two, there, didn't we?
str_battle_won_pitiless|Together, we will make the foe learn to fear our names, and to quail at our coming!
str_battle_won_cunning|Now, we must be sure to press our advantage, so that the blood shed today is not wasted.
str_battle_won_sadistic|Now let us strip their dead and leave them for the crows, so that all will know the fate of those who come against us.
str_battle_won_goodnatured|That was a good scrap! No joy like the joy of victory, eh?
str_battle_won_upstanding|Now, let us give thanks to the heavens for our victory, and mourn the many fine men who have fallen today.
str_battle_won_grudging_default|You helped turn the tide on the field, today. Whatever I may think of you, I cannot fault you for your valor.
str_battle_won_grudging_martial|{playername} -- you have shown yourself a worthy {man/woman} today, whatever your misdeeds in the past.
str_battle_won_grudging_quarrelsome|Hmf. Yours is not a face which I normally like to see, but I suppose today I should thank you for your help.
str_battle_won_grudging_pitiless|Your help was most valuable today. I would not imagine that you came to help me out of kindness, but I nonetheless thank you.
str_battle_won_grudging_cunning|It would be unwise of me not to thank you for coming to help me in my hour of need. So... You have my gratitude.
str_battle_won_grudging_sadistic|Well! How touching! {playername} has come to rescue me.
str_battle_won_grudging_goodnatured|{playername}! I can't say that we've always gotten along in the past, but you fought well today. My thanks to you!
str_battle_won_grudging_upstanding|Perhaps I was wrong about you. Your arrival was most timely. You have my gratitude.
str_battle_won_unfriendly_default|So you're here. Well, better late than never, I suppose.
str_battle_won_unfriendly_martial|We have hard harsh words in the past, but for now let us simply enjoy our victory.
str_battle_won_unfriendly_quarrelsome|If you're standing there waiting for thanks, you can keep waiting. Your help wasn't really needed, but I guess you had nothing better to do, right?
str_battle_won_unfriendly_pitiless|You have come here, like a jackal to a lion's kill. Very well then, help yourself to the spoils. I shall not stop you.
str_battle_won_unfriendly_cunning|{playername}... Well, I suppose your arrival didn't hurt, although I won't pretend that I'm happy to see you.
str_battle_won_unfriendly_sadistic|Back off, carrion fowl! This was my victory, however hard you try to steal the glory for yourself.
str_battle_won_unfriendly_goodnatured|Oh, it's you. Well, I suppose I should thank you for your help.
str_battle_won_unfriendly_upstanding|Thank you for coming to my support. Now I will be off, before I say something that I regret.
str_troop_train_request_default|I need someone like you to knock them into shape.
str_troop_train_request_martial|They need someone to show them the meaning of valor.
str_troop_train_request_quarrelsome|Fat lazy bastards. They make me puke.
str_troop_train_request_pitiless|They are more afraid of the enemy than they are of me, and this will not do.
str_troop_train_request_cunning|But men, like swords, are tempered and hardened by fire.
str_troop_train_request_sadistic|They need someone with steel in his back to flog some courage into them, or kill them trying.
str_troop_train_request_goodnatured|They're good enough lads, but I am afraid that they are not quite ready for a battle just yet.
str_troop_train_request_upstanding|It would be tantamount to murder for me to lead them into combat in their current state.
str_unprovoked_attack_default|What? Why do you attack us? Speak, you rascal!
str_unprovoked_attack_martial|I have no objection to a trial of arms, but I would ask you for what reason you attack us?
str_unprovoked_attack_quarrelsome|You're making a big mistake, {boy/girl}. What do you think you're doing?
str_unprovoked_attack_pitiless|Indeed? If you really want to die today, I'd be more than happy to oblige you, but I am curious as to what you hope to accomplish.
str_unprovoked_attack_cunning|Really? I think that you are acting most unwisely. What do you hope to gain by this?
str_unprovoked_attack_sadistic|What's this? Do you enjoy having your eyes put out?
str_unprovoked_attack_goodnatured|Why do you do this? We've got no quarrel, {sir/madame}.
str_unprovoked_attack_upstanding|I consider this an unprovoked assault, and will protest to your king. Why do you do this?
str_unnecessary_attack_default|I will not hesitate to cut you down if pressed, but I will offer you the chance to ride away from this.
str_unnecessary_attack_martial|I am eager to take you up on your challenge, {sir/madame}, although I will give you a minute to reconsider.
str_unnecessary_attack_quarrelsome|Bah! I'm in no mood for this nonsense today. Get out of my way.
str_unnecessary_attack_pitiless|I am in a merciful mood today. I will pretend that I did not hear you.
str_unnecessary_attack_cunning|I don't see what you have to gain by making an enemy of me. Maybe you should just ride away.
str_unnecessary_attack_sadistic|I have no time to waste on a worm like you. Get out of my way.
str_unnecessary_attack_goodnatured|I don't see what you have to gain by picking a fight, {sir/madame}. You can still ride away.
str_unnecessary_attack_upstanding|If a fight is what you wish, {sir/madame}, then you will have one, but I will yet offer you the chance to back down.
str_lord_challenged_default|As you wish. Prepare to die!
str_lord_challenged_martial|So be it. Defend yourself!
str_lord_challenged_quarrelsome|You impudent whelp! I'll crush you!
str_lord_challenged_pitiless|If you so badly wish to die, then I have no choice but to oblige you.
str_lord_challenged_cunning|Well, if you leave me no choice...
str_lord_challenged_sadistic|You heap of filth! I'll make you wish you'd never been born.
str_lord_challenged_goodnatured|Very well. I had hoped that we might avoid coming to blows, but I see that have no choice.
str_lord_challenged_upstanding|So be it. It saddens me that you cannot be made to see reason.
str_lord_mission_failed_default|Well, I am disappointed, but I am sure that you will have many chances to redeem yourself.
str_lord_mission_failed_martial|There is no honour in failing a quest which you endeavoured to take, but I will accept your word on it.
str_lord_mission_failed_quarrelsome|You failed? Bah. I should have expected as much from the likes of you.
str_lord_mission_failed_pitiless|You failed? Well. You disappoint me. That is a most unwise thing to do.
str_lord_mission_failed_cunning|Well, I am disappointed, but no one can guarantee that the winds of fortune will always blow their way.
str_lord_mission_failed_sadistic|Indeed? Those who fail me do not always live to regret it.
str_lord_mission_failed_goodnatured|Oh well. It was a long shot, anyway. Thank you for making an effort.
str_lord_mission_failed_upstanding|Very well. I am sure that you gave it your best effort.
str_lord_follow_refusal_default|Follow you? You forget your station, {sir/madame}.
str_lord_follow_refusal_martial|Perhaps if you one day prove yourself a valorous and honourable warrior, then I would follow you. But not today.
str_lord_follow_refusal_quarrelsome|Follow someone like you? I don't think so.
str_lord_follow_refusal_pitiless|Lords like me do not follow people like you, {sir/madame}.
str_lord_follow_refusal_cunning|First show me that you are the type of {man/woman} who will not lead me into disaster, and then perhaps I will follow you.
str_lord_follow_refusal_sadistic|I think not! Rather, you should follow me, as a whipped cur follows {his/her} master.
str_lord_follow_refusal_goodnatured|Um, I am a bit pressed with errands right now. Perhaps at a later date.
str_lord_follow_refusal_upstanding|First show me that you are worthy to lead, and then perhaps I will follow.

str_rebellion_dilemma_martial|{s45} was clearly wronged. Although I gave an oath to {s46}, it does not bind me to support him if he usurped his throne illegally.
str_rebellion_dilemma_quarrelsome|Hmm. {s46} has never given me my due, so I don't figure I owe him much. However, maybe {s45} will be no better, and {s46} has at least shown himself .
str_rebellion_dilemma_pitiless|Hmm. {s45} says {reg3?she:he} is the rightful heir to the throne. That is good -- it absolves me of my oath to {s46}. But still I must weight my decision carefully.
str_rebellion_dilemma_cunning|Hmm. I gave an oath of homage to {s46}, yet the powerful are not bound by their oaths as our ordinary people. Our duty is to our own ability to rule, to impose order and prevent the war of all against all.
str_rebellion_dilemma_sadistic|Hmm. In this vile world, a wise man must think of himself, for no one else will. So -- what's in it for me?
str_rebellion_dilemma_goodnatured|I do not know what to say. I gave an oath to {s46} as the lawful ruler, but if he is not the lawful ruler, I don't know if I am still bound.
str_rebellion_dilemma_upstanding|This is troublesome. It is a grave thing to declare my homage to {s46} to be null and void, and dissolve the bonds which keep our land from sinking into anarchy. Yet I am also pledged to support the legitimacy of the succession, and {s45} also has a valid claim to the throne.
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_martial|On the other hand, {s46} has led us in war and peace, and I am loathe to renounce my allegiance.
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_quarrelsome|So tell me, why should I turn my back on the bastard I know, in favor of {reg3?a woman:the bastard} I don't know?
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_pitiless|It is a most perilous position to be in, to be asked whom I would make {reg3?ruler:king} of this land. Yet it is also a time of opportunity, for me to reap the rewards that have always been my due!
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_cunning|{s46} has been challenged, and thus he will never be able to rule as strongly as one whose claim has never been questioned. Yet if {s45} takes the throne by force, {reg3?she:he} will not be as strong as one who succeeded peacefully.
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_sadistic|Perhaps if I join {s45} while {reg3?she:he} is still weak {reg3?she:he} will enrich me, but perhaps if I bring {s46} your head he will give me an even greater reward.
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_goodnatured|{s46} has always treated me decently, yet it's true that he did wrong to {s45}. I hesitate to renounce my homage to {s46}, yet I also don't think it's right to support injustice.
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_upstanding|I feel that I must do whatever is best for the realm, to avoid it being laid waste by civil war and ravaged by its enemies.
str_political_philosophy_martial|My sword is at the disposal of my rightful liege, so long as he upholds his duty to me.
str_political_philosophy_quarrelsome|Bah. They're all a bunch of bastards. I try to make sure that the ones who wrong me learn to regret it.
str_political_philosophy_pitiless|Men will always try to cheat others of their rightful due. In this faithless world, each must remain vigilant of his own rights.
str_political_philosophy_cunning|Well, it's a harsh world, and it is our lot to face harsh choices. Sometimes one must serve a tyrant to keep the peace, but sometimes a bit of rebellion keeps the kings honest. Circumstance is all.
str_political_philosophy_sadistic|My philosophy is simple: it is better to be the wolf than the lamb.
str_political_philosophy_goodnatured|Well, you should keep faith with your promises, and not do injustice to others. Sometimes it's hard to balance those. Stick with people you trust, I think, and it's hard to go far wrong.
str_political_philosophy_upstanding|Kingship and lordship have been instituted to keep the peace and prevent the war of all against all, yet that must not blind us to the possibility of injustice.
str_political_philosophy_roguish|Hmm.. I guess I'm thinking that it's good to be a lord.
str_political_philosophy_benefactor|A good ruler makes sure all are treated justly. Personally, I intend to use my authority to better the lot of those who live in my demesne.

str_rebellion_rival_martial|{s49} your ally {s44} once questioned my honour and my bravery. It's not often I get the chance to face him in battle, and make him retract his statement.
str_rebellion_rival_quarrelsome|{s49} you're working with {s44}. He's a crafty weasel, and I don't trust him one bit.
str_rebellion_rival_pitiless|{s49} you seem to have enlisted the support of {s44} -- who is soft, and weak, and not fit to govern a fief, and whom I have always detested.
str_rebellion_rival_cunning|{s49} {s44}, who has already joined you, is headstrong and quarrelsome, and a bit of liability.
str_rebellion_rival_sadistic|{s49} I have no desire to fight alongside your ally {s44}, who puts on such a nauseating display of virtue.
str_rebellion_rival_goodnatured|{s49} I'd be reluctant to be on the same side as {s44}, who has quite a reputation for cruelty.
str_rebellion_rival_upstanding|{s49} your ally {s44} is in my opinion a dangerous, unreliable, and highly unprincipled man.
str_rebellion_argument_favorable|I respect your line of argument

str_rebellion_agree_martial|I have decided. I will back {s45} as the rightful heir.
str_rebellion_agree_quarrelsome|Ahh, I've thought long enough. I never did like {s46} much anyway. Let's go take his throne away from him.
str_rebellion_agree_pitiless|You are fortunate. I have decided to join you. Pray do not give me cause to regret this decision.
str_rebellion_agree_cunning|This is a most dangerous decision, but after careful consideration, I have decided that I will join you. Let's hope it is for the best.
str_rebellion_agree_sadistic|I have decided. I will back your {reg3?woman:man} {s45}. But you'd best make sure that {reg3?she:he} rewards me well!
str_rebellion_agree_goodnatured|All right. I think your {reg3?woman:man} will be a good ruler. I'll join you.
str_rebellion_agree_upstanding|So be it. My first duty is to this realm, and to save it from lawlessness I will back {s45} and renounce my homage to {s46}. May the Heavens forgive me if I do wrong.
str_rebellion_refuse_martial|I am sorry. {s45} has a good claim, but it's not enough for me to turn my back on {s46}. I will remain loyal to my liege.

str_talk_later_pitiless|Still your tongue! Whatever I have to say on this matter, I will not say it here and now, while we are in the midst of our army.
str_talk_later_cunning|This is hardly the time or the place for such a discussion. Perhaps we can discuss it at a later time and a different place, but for now we're still foes.

str_changed_my_mind_upstanding|However, you make an eloquent case. I am still listening.
str_swadian_rebellion_pretender_intro|I am Charles the Second, king of Navarre and rightful ruler of France.
str_vaegir_rebellion_pretender_intro|I am Owain Lawgoch, known as Owain of the Red Hand to the English and Yvain de Galles to the French. I hail from neither, however. I am the rightful king of the Britons and thus of all Britain.
str_khergit_rebellion_pretender_intro|I am Dustum Khan, son of Janakir Khan, and rightful Khan of the Khergits.
str_nord_rebellion_pretender_intro|I am Lethwin Far-Seeker, son of Hakrim the Old, who should be king of the Nords of Calradia.
str_rhodok_rebellion_pretender_intro|I am Lord Kastor, the rightful King of the Rhodoks, who will free them from tyranny.
str_sarranid_rebellion_pretender_intro|I am Arwa, whom they call the Pearled One, Mother of the Sarranids and their rightful Queen.
str_swadian_rebellion_pretender_story_1|By rights I should be King of France, but the machinations of the French and the iniquities of the English have thus far kept me from what should be mine. From what will, inevitably, be mine. None in the land has better claim to the throne than I for I am born of the fleur de lys on both sides. My father was first cousin to Philip the Sixth of the House of Valois and my mother was the only daughter of Louis the Tenth of House Capet.
str_vaegir_rebellion_pretender_story_1|Long have the English wronged the people of Wales. Ever since the reign of Edward Longshanks, Hammer of the Scots, Wales has been under English rule and I am angry to see that no Welshman has done anything to stop the bastards. I still remember Edward's deception. A group of Welsh nobles asked him to name a Welshman Prince of Wales to ensure our loyalty. Longshanks said he would give us a Prince who spoke no English at all and he then presented us his infant son who was as Welsh as I am Italian.
str_khergit_rebellion_pretender_story_1|Sanjar Khan and I are brothers, sons of the old Janakir Khan, although of different mothers. Although I was the younger brother, all those who knew the old Khan will testify that throughout my father's life, I was his favorite, entrusted with the responsibilities of government. Sanjar busied himself with hunts and feasts to win the affection of the more dissolate of my father's commanders.
str_nord_rebellion_pretender_story_1|I am called the Far-Seeker because I have travelled great distances, even by the standards of the Nords, in search of knowledge. Before I came of age, my father sent me abroad on a tour of study at the courts and universities in the lands overseas. If the Nords are to call themselves the heirs of the Calradian empire, then they must act the part, and know something of law and letters, and not call themselves content merely to fight, plunder, and drink.
str_rhodok_rebellion_pretender_story_1|The Rhodoks are a free people, and not slaves to any hereditary monarch. The king must be chosen from one of the leading noble families of the land, by a council drawn by lot from the patricians of the cities of Jelkala, Veluca, and Yalen. The council meets on a field before Jelkala, and no man is allowed to appear in arms during their deliberations, on pain of death.
str_sarranid_rebellion_pretender_story_1|I was born in a faraway land, to a humble family, and made a slave when I was but a girl -- but there is no shame in that, for the mothers of many of our kings were slaves. The old Sultan, Ayzar, spotted me in the markets and was struck by my beauty. I entered his household, and there he also learned to respect my intelligence. As he grew older, he allowed me to govern in his stead. First I managed the affairs of the palace, and later those of the realm.
str_swadian_rebellion_pretender_story_2|My family, however, was wronged since before my birth. My mother was the grand-daughter of Philip the Fair, former king of France, and the daughter of Louis the Tenth, then-king of France. A daughter of kings born of a noble line yet she was wronged by her own uncle, the brother of her father. We now call this usurper Philip the Fifth, former king of France. In truth, however, we should be calling my mother not Joan of Navarre, but Joan queen of France.
str_vaegir_rebellion_pretender_story_2|Ever since I was young, I realized that there was no place for me in Britain. So I left for France and raised my own Free Company. I found that the French delight in using Welshmen, Irishmen and Scots against the English. They are also quite open minded when it comes to the independence of the peoples subjugated by the English. Thus far the Scots have their independence. Why shouldn't we Welsh have ours?
str_khergit_rebellion_pretender_story_2|According to Khergit custom, when a man dies his herds are split between all his sons, equally. So too it is with the khanate. When I heard of my father's death, I was away inspecting our borders, but I hurried home to Tulga, ready to give Sanjar his due and share the khanate with him. But when I arrived, I found that he rushed his supporters to the court, to have himself proclaimed as the sole khan.
str_nord_rebellion_pretender_story_2|My father died however before I completed my course of study, and as I hurried home to claim his throne my ship was wrecked by a storm. One of my father's thanes, Ragnar, seized this opportunity and spread rumors that I had died abroad. He summoned a gathering of his supporters to have himself proclaimed king, and has taken the past few years to consolidate his power.
str_rhodok_rebellion_pretender_story_2|During the last selection, there were but two candidates, myself, and Lord Graveth. While the council was deliberating, Graveth appeared, sword in hand, telling them that a Swadian raiding party was about to descend on the field of deliberation -- which was true, by the way -- and if he were not elected king, then he would leave them to their fate.
str_sarranid_rebellion_pretender_story_2|When Sultan Ayzar died, it seemed to the emirs of the realm only natural that I should succeed him as ruler, thus avoiding any danger of civil war. They insisted, however, that I should marry one of his generals, the Emir Baybak. The emirs then lined up to give us the oath of allegiance together -- to Baybak as Commander of the Armies, and to me as Mother of the Realm. For the brief time that we ruled, our realm prospered.
str_swadian_rebellion_pretender_story_3|Any man that says I should not be king of France by right is either a fool or one who would gain from the usurping of my power. The man who calls himself king of France now is one such man. He, however, is no king. His grandfather had no right to be king just as he has no right to be king. And the king of England has no such right either. I, however, do. And I shall pursue my birth-right to the last breath if need be.
str_vaegir_rebellion_pretender_story_3|I am the last descendant of Llywelyn the Great in the male line. I come from an unbroken line of nobles of Wales. The English may say that we Welsh are a savage people who need them to civilize us but I say differently. Wales should have its Prince. And the native people of Britain should have their own kingdom once more. The English are just invaders, sons of the Vikings and Normans who have ravaged our shores for centuries. The Britons need their king and I am a man worthy enough to be one.
str_khergit_rebellion_pretender_story_3|My brother thinks that Khergits will only respect strength: a leader who takes what he wants, when he wants it. But I think that he misreads the spirit of our people.--we admire a resolute leader, but even more we a just one, and we know that a man who does not respect his own brother's rights will not respect the rights of his followers.
str_nord_rebellion_pretender_story_3|So I remain in exile -- except now I am not looking for sages to tutor me in the wisdom of faraway lands, but warriors, to come with me back to the land of the Nords and regain my throne. If Ragnar doubts my ability to rule, then let him say so face to face, as we stare at each other over the rims of our shields. For a warrior can be a scholar, and a scholar a warrior, and to my mind, only one who combines the two is fit to be king!
str_rhodok_rebellion_pretender_story_3|Well, Graveth defeated the Swadians, and for that, as a Rhodok, I am grateful. When I am king, I will myself place the wreath of victory on his head. But after that I will have it separated from his shoulders, for by his actions he has shown himself a traitor to the Rhodok confederacy and its sacred custom.
str_sarranid_rebellion_pretender_story_3|But alas, Baybak himself was soon killed in a skirmish with the Khergits. Had I known of his death in time, I would have been able to prepare myself against any possibility of betrayal. But alas, my husband's treacherous nephew Hakim came riding with his men, still covered with the dust of the battlefield, and drove me from the palace at swordpoint and proclaimed himself sultan. So be it -- I shall gather an army of my own, and return him the favor.
str_swadian_rebellion_monarch_response_1|Charles of Navarre has the boldness to desire the throne of France. He styles himself a king yet any who know him will tell you that he is far from one. He is cruel to his subjects and defiant to his betters and he is treacherous in his dealings both with the Kingdom of France and the Kingdom of England. All he desires is to further his own power above that of others and for that he will stop at nothing.
str_vaegir_rebellion_monarch_response_1|Owain is a very interesting character. I assume he has not told you that his father and his father's father before him were gentlemen of the realm of England. Though Owain likes to claim that he comes from an unbroken line of Welsh nobles, his closest ancestors and even himself, before he fled the country, were respectable English nobles. He actually has quite a lot of English blood in him, for all his talk of the English usurping Britain.
str_khergit_rebellion_monarch_response_1|My brother Dustum has perhaps told you of his insistence upon splitting the khanate, as though it were a herd of sheep. Let me tell you something. Ever since the Khergits established themselves on this land, the death of every khan has had the same result -- the land was divided, the khan's sons went to war, and the strongest took it all anyway. I simply had the foresight to stave off the civil war in advance.
str_nord_rebellion_monarch_response_1|Lethwin 'Far-Seeker'? Lethwin Inkfingers, is more like it. Perhaps you have heard the expression, 'Unhappy is the land whose king is a child.' Unhappy too is the land whose king is a student. You want the Nords to be ruled by a beardless youth, whose hand bears no callouses left by a sword's grip, who has never stood in a shield wall? If Lethwin were king, his thanes would laugh at him to his face!
str_rhodok_rebellion_monarch_response_1|No doubt Lord Kastor told you that I defiled the hallowed Rhodok custom by interfering with the patricians' election of a king. Well, let me tell you something. The patricians of the towns make long-winded speeches about our ancient liberties, but then choose as their king whichever noble last sat in their villa and sipped a fine wine and promised to overlook their unpaid taxes.
str_sarranid_rebellion_monarch_response_1|Our scholars have long agreed that there is one overriding principle in politics. Men should accept the authority of the ruler, because tyranny is better than civil war. It was for that reason that I accepted the authority of both Baybak and Arwa, to whom I gave my oath as co-rulers.
str_swadian_rebellion_monarch_response_2|His ancestors may have been the daughters or cousins of kings, but it is clear that the blood of kings has been all but spent in Charles. True enough, my own grandsire was merely the brother of a king, but France was in danger and he couldn't just leave the crown of France to the King of England and his treacherous mother. So he did what any Frenchman should and ensured that the crown stayed on the brow of a Frenchman. What Charles is doing now is sowing chaos in an already bloodied land.
str_vaegir_rebellion_monarch_response_2|Truth be told, the Welsh have had no true leader since Llywelyn the Great. After Llywelyn, his horde of heirs and bastards tore their father's realm between themselves, each and every one of them hungry for power. Owain of the Red Hand is just the descendant of one of these heirs or maybe even bastards and much like his sires he desires one thing. Power. And I pity the man who will try and help him achieve his goals, for he is an enemy of England and of its people.
str_khergit_rebellion_monarch_response_2|Dustum would make a fine assessor of flocks, or adjudicator of land disputes. But can you imagine such a man as khan? We would be run off of our land in no time by our neighbors, and return to our old days of starving and freezing on the steppe.
str_nord_rebellion_monarch_response_2|Old Hakrim may have had fancy ideas about how to dispose of his kingdom, but it is not just royal blood that makes a King of the Nords. I am king by acclamation of the thanes, and by right of being the strongest. That counts for more than blood, and woe to any man in this land who says otherwise.
str_rhodok_rebellion_monarch_response_2|The only liberty that concerns them is their liberty to grow fat. Meanwhile, my men sleep out on the steppe, and eat dry bread and salt fish, and scan the horizon for burning villages, and shed our blood to keep the caravan routes open. Here's an idea -- if I ever meet a merchant who limps from a Khergit arrow-wound or a Swadian sword-stroke, then I'll say, 'Here's a man whose counsel is worth taking.'
str_sarranid_rebellion_monarch_response_2|You should know, however, that Arwa was not chosen as Baybak's partner because of her wisdom or love of justice. No, she was chosen because she was a witch, who could transform men like Ayzar and Baybak into stammering fools. No matter -- I was true to my oath, and respected her usurpation, until the very hour that it was invalidated by the death of her puppet. Now she must respect mine.

str_feast_lengthy_description_1|The food you provided was insufficient for your guests and their retinues, forcing them to purchase their sustenance from the surrounding countryside at grossly inflated prices. The consensus among those who attended was that you failed to do your duty as a host, diminishing both their trust in you and your overall reputation.
str_feast_lengthy_description_2|The food and drink you provided eventually ran out, forcing some guests to either buy their own from passing peddlars, or send some of their retinue home early. The more charitable attributed the shortfall to poor planning rather than meanness, but either way, it did your reputation no good.
str_feast_lengthy_description_3|The food and drink you provided was adequate for your noble guests, although some of the commoners in their retinues went without. You are establishing a reputation as one who has at least a grasp of your social obligations as a noble.
str_feast_lengthy_description_4|You have provided enough food and drink, and with sufficient varieties, to do yourself credit. The food, drink, and merriment have loosened your guests tongues, allowing them to converse candidly about the matters of the realm, and deepening their trust in you.
str_feast_lengthy_description_5|You have provided a bountiful table not just for your noble guests but for their retinues, with food left over to be distributed to the poor. Your guests lavish praise upon you for your generosity, and for your understanding of the social obligations of your rank. The conversation, fueled by the food and drink, has been merry, strengthening the bonds between those who attended.
str_feast_lengthy_description_6|The realm will be speaking of the bounty of your table for months to come, and it will become the standard to which all other feasts will aspire. You have filled the bellies not just of your noble guests and their retinues, but also of the poor who flocked to the gates.

Once a bright eyed merchant who arrived at Tihr with a small fortune in rubies and a dream to corner the velvet market, he was soon reduced to a pauper, having lost everything to cut-throat competition with the colluding Rhodok merchant guilds. But he soon turned measuring scales into swords, and applied his considerable business smarts into building up the deadliest criminal enterprise in Veluca, with hideouts and operations in every major town. He has attained his goal, for the price on his head is greater than the riches he once pursued. Now he takes great pleasure in relieving his former competitors of their worldly goods -— and worries.

Her shrewd, decisive manner, combined with her merciless ambition which she acts upon with inhuman composure and cruelty, garners fanatic admiration from those that follow her. As such, amongst her own she lives a decadent, spoilt lifestyle -- built upon the violent plundering she exacts in her travels. Her military strength and natural strategic wit allowed her outfit to remain undealt with in her homeland, and now she turns her eye towards the rich lands of Calradia to sustain her war band.

After being knighted he served as a paid knight in the army of the lord of Uxkhal and fought against the Vaegirs before leading a group of outriders that defeated a Khergit raid near Amere. The ensuing counter raid and the following two campaigns earned him glory and fame as a warrior. Unfortunately, he lost any chance of further prestige when peace was declared and he was discharged. With no hope of inheriting and his skills at war languishing in peace, he assembled other young warriors and set out as a mercenary captain. He now hopes to take advantage of the fact that Calradia never lacks warring states in need of mercenaries.
str_quick_battle_troop_4|Konrad is a professional mercenary from the distant land of Balion, far beyond the vast western ocean. Having spent most of his years on campaign and seen countless battles, Konrad has grown to love his life as a soldier of fortune. Though he once had his nose flattened by a mace blow and has received many wounds, he has nevertheless survived this harsh existence through the strength of his arm, innate cunning and pure luck. Hearing of the lucrative career opportunities awaiting a man of his talents in Calradia, Konrad chartered a vessel and crossed the sea with his men in search of new wars to fight in. A sellsword with no ties to any of the Calradian states, he is more than happy to offer his services to any lord with a fat enough coin-purse.
str_quick_battle_troop_5|Sverre is one of the so-called sea raiders -- freebooters and lawless men from the icy realm of Jumne beyond the North Sea, also said to be the ancestral home of the Nords. Already as a young man he has been along on many raids against both his distant cousins in the Wercheg region and the Vaegirs. However, Sverre was always a sharp lad, and it didn't take him long to see that Calradia was a far more prosperous land than his own, and that he could have a better life here than among his own people. During a raid on Jayek, Sverre stole away while his comrades were busy looting the village and taking captives. Passing himself off as a yokel from the Chalbek mountains, Sverre quickly built up a reputation for himself as a fierce fighter, and he now seeks his fortune at the head of a mercenary band.
str_quick_battle_troop_6|Hailing from Charnye, in the far reaches of the Vaegir tundra, Borislav is a hunter. For all of his life he has tracked the beasts of the wild for their meat and fur, living off the land just as his forefathers had done in happier days, before the endless wars. Now, the game is quick to take fright from the constant sounds of battle, and the wanton slaughter of animals by soldiers has left empty those forests that have not been burnt down. Facing starvation, Borislav chose to turn his great skill with bow and spear, learned from hunting stag, wolf, and bear, to the practice of hunting men, and his steady hand and keen eye have claimed many lives. Borislav does not care much for the disputes of kingdoms, and is only really interested in keeping himself and his men fed.
str_quick_battle_troop_7|Stavros was born in the independent city-state of Zendar, and spent much of his adult life serving in the town watch under the famous constable Hareck. Stavros' leadership and prowess were instrumental in ridding the area of the dreaded river pirates, but even he was powerless against the calamity that befell the city. When Zendar was razed to the ground by a great horde of sea raiders, Stavros fled the burning city in a crowd of refugees. After a brief period of wandering and odd jobs, he found a place in a mercenary company, eventually rising to become its leader due to his dedication and tactical aptitude. He now devotes most of his efforts to working with manhunters and local authorities against the sea raiders and other outlaws, trying to keep the land safe for travellers.
str_quick_battle_troop_8|Growing up with one of the nomadic tribes deep in the desert beyond Sarranid lands, Gamara learned early on how to hunt with sling and spear. However, the simple life and pitiless conditions in the desert did not satisfy her, and she burned with a desire to see the great world beyond that she had heard so many wondrous tales about. Life is not easy for an adventuring young woman, and Gamara had to learn the ways of Calradia quickly. Taking the weapons and armor of a soldier who had attacked her after a dispute, Gamara now hides her beauty under thick Sarranid garb, and many never even suspect she is a woman –- certainly as a force on the battlefield she is as dangerous as any man. She has gathered about her a group of followers, and together they wander the war-torn land in search of glory.
str_quick_battle_troop_9|Aethrod is not a noble person. He's changed his name twice, and is blamed for most of the crimes on Vaegir territory. True or not, he claims to never have taken an innocent man's life, and considers himself a patriotic citizen, several times bringing his band or renegades to the assistance of his faction, when it is threatened. In times of peace, however, most lords must be careful when he is in the vicinity due to his daring personality and willingness to challenge a lord. Born and raised in the slums of Reyvadin, he learned how to use a bow at an early age and ran away from home a fourteen. Now at thirty two, his archery skills are near perfect and though he can't ride a horse well, he can hit one at the furthest of distances. Tough as nails and sharp as a hawk, he is a true local legend.
str_quick_battle_troop_10|Being the daughter of one of the most infamous bandit leaders in the Sarranid realm isn't always easy, but Zaira seems to have managed quite well. Unlike most women she grew up learning the ways of the desert warrior and is deadly with the sword as well as the bow. While the other girls her age learned how to manage the household, Zaira learned how to best gut a merchant before taking his money. At the age of sixteen Zaira had killed more men than the average veteran in the Sultan's army. Just before her twentieth brithday her father was killed in brawl with another bandit leader. As the only child, Zaira now took control of her father's band. After avenging her father, she quickly picked up where he had left. Now she's on a good way of establishing her own reputation has a bandit leader.
str_quick_battle_troop_11|Argo Sendnar had quite a diversified life. When he arrived at Calradia, working as a trader, he hoped for more income than in Lokti. Little did he know, that the war-torn Calradia was a wasps' nest for bandits and cut-throats that made trading a lot more complicated than in Lokti. Being bought out by another competing trader, after losing all his goods and money due to caravan raids, he was forced to serve as a caravan guard to make a living. Despite his pathetic fighting skills, he soon found an employment on one of the more dangerous routes through Calradia. Due to sheer luck he managed to stay alive long enough to aquire enough combat experience and money to start his own business as a caravan master, offering his services to traders in need of defense for their goods.

str_merchant_and_you_call_some_townsmen_and_guards_to_get_ready_and_you_get_out_from_tavern|You leave the tavern and go out to the streets. Nervous looking young men are waiting in every street corner. You can see they have daggers and clubs concealed under their clothes, and catch a mixture of fear, anticipation and pride in the quick looks they throw at you as you pass by. Praying that your enemies have not been alarmed by this all too obvious bunch of plotters, you check your weapons for one last time and prepare yourself for the action ahead.
str_town_fight_ended_you_and_citizens_cleaned_town_from_bandits|The remaining few bandits scatter off to the town's narrow alleys, only to be hunted down one by one by the angry townsfolk.

str_town_fight_ended_you_and_citizens_cleaned_town_from_bandits_you_wounded|You fall down with that last blow, unable to move and trying hard not to pass out. Soon the sounds of fighting filling the street gives way to the cheers of the townsmen and you realize with relief that your side won the day. Soon, friendly arms pick you up from the ground and you let yourself drift off to a blissful sleep. Hours later, you wake up in the merchants house.
str_journey_to_reyvadin|You have come across the choppy waters of the English Channel to Cean, in Northern France. The land about the English-held town looks well tended and peaceful, with the peasantry going about their daily labor. Yet here and there can be seen the burnt out shell of an old building, or a grassy ditch from siege-works of years ago. Grizzled men look up from hoe or scythe, bearing scars of a conflict old enough for tales but fresh enough for sorrows. As you enter Cean, a band of soldiers in gleaming harness laugh and jest as they ride out through the gate. There is war still, upon the air.
str_journey_to_praven|You joined with a band of pilgrims, although your intent may not have been as pure as theirs. Lands of scorching sun; green, sweet-scented vineyards; high castles on their hills or thick walls of towns. You have come by many ways to the city of Dijon, in the East of France. There may be a shrine here, but it is not what you have come to see. No, there is rumor of war on the sea-breezes. France has been sorely afflicted with peace since a certain treaty with the English throne, and you are here to have a say in the matter, one way or another.
str_journey_to_jelkala|You came by ship, skirting the cliffs where the Rhodok highlands meet the sea. Much of the coastline was obscured by tendrils of fog that snaked down the river valleys, but occasionally you caught sight of a castle watchtower rising above the mists -- and on one occasion, a beacon fire burning to warn of an enemy warband. You knew that you were relatively safe at sea, as you were too far south to risk encountering the sea raiders who trouble the coasts of the Nordic lands, but it was still a relief to reach the Selver estuary, gateway to the port of Jelkala, and see a Rhodok galley riding at anchor, its pennants fluttering in the evening breeze.
str_journey_to_sargoth|You took passage with a trading longship, carrying gyrfalcons from the furthest reaches of the north to be bartered for linen and wool. It sailed early in the season, but the master reckoned that the risks of drifting ice and later winter storms could be justified by arriving ahead of the Sea Raiders, who by April would be sailing forth from their island lairs to ravage Calradia's coasts. It was some relief when your ship came in sight of the delta of the Vyl and Boluk rivers, and a short while later, rowed past tidal flats and coastal marshes to the city of Sargoth, home to the Sea Raiders' distant kinsmen, the Nordic lords, who a few generations ago had carved themselves a kingdom in this rich but troubled land.
str_journey_to_tulga|You came with a caravan, crossing the mountains that border Calradia on the north and east, bringing spices from faraway lands to trade for wool and salt. The passes were still choked with snow, and it was hard going, but at last you crested a ridge and saw before you the Calradian steppes. On some hillsides the thin grass of spring was already turning yellow, but the lower slopes of the mountains were still a vibrant green. Herds of sheep and tawny steppe ponies drifted across them like clouds, testifying to the wealth of the Khergit khans. From time to time small groups of horsemen would follow your caravan from a distance, perhaps sizing up how well you could defend the wealth you carried, so it was with some relief that you saw the towers of Tulga rising up from the plains.
str_journey_to_shariz|You came with a caravan, crossing the great desert to the east of Calradia. The bedouin guides chose your route carefully, leapfrogging through treacherous dune fields and across empty gravel plains to low-lying oases rich with orchards and date palms. Your great fear was that the caravan might lose its way and perish of thirst. The small bands of raiders who hovered just out of bowshot, waiting to pick off stragglers, were oddly a comfort -- at least water could be no more than a day's ride away. It was a great relief when the mountains came into view, and on the evening of the following day you crested a rocky pass and in the distance could make out the sea, and the towers of Shariz silhouetted against the sunset.
str_lost_tavern_duel_ordinary|You slump to the floor, stunned by the drunk's last blow. Your attacker's rage immediately seems to slacken. He drops into a chair and sits there watching you, muttering under his breath, almost regretfully. A few of the other patrons manage to coax him to his feet and bundle him out the door. One of the others attends to your wounds, and soon you too are back on your feet, unsteady but alive.
str_lost_tavern_duel_assassin|You slump to the floor, stunned by your attacker's last blow. Slowly and deliberately, he kneels down by your side, pulling a long knife from under his clothes. But before he can finish you off, the tavern keeper, who seems to have regained his courage, comes up from behind and gives your attacker a clout behind the head. He loses his balance, and then, seeing that his chance to kill you has been lost, makes a dash for the door. He gets away. Meanwhile, the other tavern patrons bind your wounds and haul you to a back room to rest and recover.
str_lost_startup_hideout_attack|You recover consciousness a short while later, and see that the kidnappers have celebrated their victory by breaking open a cask of wine, and have forgotten to take a few elementary precautions -- like binding your hands and feet. You manage to slip away. Based on the boisterous sounds coming from the hideout, you suspect that you may yet have some time to gather a few more followers and launch another attack.
